You know it's not that easy to become a citizen of another country, right?

There are also [renunciation fees of $2,350 and taxes](https://nl.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/citizenship-services/renunciation-u-s-citizenship/).

US ""exit tax"" for higher-earners (~$160k+) on your assets, which would include your Bitcoin. Basically, you'll pay the capital gains tax.

> moves to some other country with low tax rates 

Moving is expense. $10k-$20k for your shipping container alone. If you sell your house, that'll be taxed too.

It's going to take you a while to establish credit in your new country. Of course, depending on where you are going, you could well have higher income taxes (e.g. Europe) that will offset any reduced long-term capital gains taxes.

dpxy0at,7dd9m3,"The altcoin market exploded earlier this year as BTC mempool was getting congested (see ETH and LTC). I know many old school Bitcoin people do not think altcoins would have a place in the market if Bitcoin had fast transactions and low fees. The mempool always being full is a recent development as of last year. Look at the declining market dominance of BTC this past year https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage.

BTC not scaling is leaving room for coins like ETH, LTC, DASH, even BCH to grow. Merchants and business that actually use the blockchain to transact are not going to wait for BTC to scale they will just use alternative cryptos.

This weekends shenanigans with BCH was very similar to the ETH flippening attempt this past May. In May BTC was all backed up and expensive to use meanwhile ETH was doing more transactions per day at a fraction of the cost than BTC. People were freaking out trying to send their BTC to exchanges to buy ETH before it flipped. Of course it did not flip but BTC not having a scaling solution leaves it vulnerable to these situations. ",1510889306.0,2,sgspace321
dpxecs4,7dd9m3,"The problem BTC will face is unlike fiat that can be used for very large and very small transactions, transaction fees prohibit very small transactions from making sense if the chain is used for very large transactions.

The value of 1 satoshi is the ability to place a transaction on the blockchain. By itself, it's worthless. The security surrounding the blockchain is what gives it value. When you receive coins, you expect the transaction to persist and you expect to be able to transfer these coins after some period of time. This security is equal to the block value (reward + fees). Block reward is inflation which is equivalent to every bitcoin holder losing a small amount of their coins, essentially paying a holding fee per block. As reward diminishes, tx fees must take over. If blocks are not filled, fees will be near 0 and hashpower will also be near 0, making the chain vulnerable and coin value to be driven by faith alone.

Blocks being full is therefore good for the fee economy. They are full because small value transactions fight for space and drive the fees up. However, we see that they are migrating toward lower security chains because it's not worth it to pay 5$ to secure a 20$ transaction. Once these no longer fight for block space, block fees will be reduced which will reduce chain security and large va;ie transactions will become less secure, forcing them to go to more secure alternatives. It's a negative feedback loop. It's currently mitigated by block reward being a large part of block reward.

The only way for this to work out in the end is for each category of transaction to have their own blockchain and to maintain a constant transaction count in time. If a chain becomes full, it will enter in the positive feedback loop phase that bitcoin is going through right now, until lower value transactions migrate again. At some point, we will have 2 chains operate in the same value space, so unless transaction demand is there to fill both, they will crash.

To allow every type of transaction in a single chain, blocks need to be filled to maintain the positive feedback loop, but they need to be large enough to allow low value transactions to eventually get in cheaply when there's a lack of high value transactions to fully fill the block. Ideal block size should therefore be slightly under the average sum of transaction size during a normal block time.",1510867152.0,3,Tiblanc-

Then the security of the chain will be proportional to the popularity of Bitcoin. People don't mind to pay a few cents for a transaction. Miners can also require a minimum fee. Surely, competition between miners will keep the minimum fee as low as possible.

The problem with full blocks and very high fees is that it won't allow Bitcoin to be populair. With the current tx capacity, even if an average user only makes 2 tx per year, adoption is  limited to 67 million users.

There are many classes of transactions :
- tipping

- buying a car
- buying a house
- investments
- large company cash transfer

A blockchain lifecycle starts with the top class where it makes sense to carry transactions on it. As adoption grows and price goes up, the next class starts to make sense due to increased security. This positive feedback loop continues until the next class starts to make economic sense. There is still some risk, but it's much cheaper than current alternatives. At that point, the first class starts to be priced out because block size is limited.

For a blockchain to be used for multi-million dollar transactions, it needs to grow through the classes and price out lower tier classes. We're getting close to paycheck and car classes, as evidenced by remittances and online purchases being priced out.",1510881844.0,1,Tiblanc-

dpxped4,7dd8nl,"> what does local supply a bitcoin mean? 

All exchanges have a limited number of coins on them. It's a matter of what people have deposited. African exchanges have fewer total coins than most other exchanges. When you have different volumes, and reasons for why people might be adverse to arbitrage exist, you get price differences.

No one is trading physical coins. There are just always regional price differences based on physical proximity and legislative borders. For example, Australian exchanges have Bitcoin valued higher than US exchanges, even after accounting for the difference in dollar value. There's no real risk associated with the exchange. Arbitrage to Australia is just difficult because of taxation law around capital gains. Difficult arbitrage + with low volume = higher price.

The reason that few people are jumping on the arbitrage bandwagon in Zimbabwe's situation is because they don't trust putting my money on an African exchange. How do I know that they actually have all the coins that they're saying they have? How do I know that they wont shut up shop after I deposit my coins? What are their withdrawal times? What currency can you reasonably expect to withdraw? How long will it take me to fund the exchange? All these factors and many more play a role in whether or not arbitrage can be done successfully. I'm sure there are people with higher risk tolerance than mine who are taking advantage of the arbitrage and will eventually stabilise the market.

As an aside the reason you generally can't arbitrage with crypto in panic situations is because the other crypto is also inflated as well. Your option is cash, which has a withdrawal time and limits your ability to buy/sell repeatedly for large profits. ",1510879588.0,1,magpietongue

Using bloom filters the Bitcoin Cash devs (including Gavin Andresen, the dev Blockstream blocked commit access to in github) have figured out how to keep from rebroadcasting allowing for AT LEAST 10X the amount of throughput with the same bandwidth.  

Don't let the propaganda machine in /r/bitcoin fool you.  Bitcoin Cash is real and a LOT of devs are working on it.  

Are you aware of the /r/btc sub.  You may want to check that out now and then.  After being in bitcoin since 2012 I can absolutely tell you Bitcoin Cash is definitely what Bitcoin was originally intended to be.   Now, that's not saying I don't like Bitcoin.  Both were competing visions amongst the devs before the split so the split was healthy.  I hope they both succeed.

From the perspective of orginal devs like Gavin Andresen that's exactly what ALREADY happened to bitcoin.  They are right.  Bitcoin Cash IS Bitcoin--from that perspective.

dpxta76,7dd7e3,"Here's a scenario:

- Largest global product producers and governments need a standard IoT protocol. They adopt IOTA, the far leading front-runner.

- 10 years from now, 70% of the products around you now have IOTA powered features to enable the perks of an IoT economy, encompassing B2B, B2C and P2P. One current B2C example is Amazon's Alexa, or Google Home. You ask Alexa to buy something for you, and she, the *machine*, does so. 

- As IOTA is designed to be used by machines *behind the scenes*, consumers theoretically wouldn't ever need to know IOTA exists -- Consumers pay in fiat, but machines instantly convert that fiat to IOTA before it hits the Tangle Network. 
*Amazon just freed itself from have to pay another .8% fee to a payment gateway provider like VISA.

- People learn about IOTA, the ""machine network and money"" powering their things, through traditional media and platforms like Reddit. This drives huge demand for IOTA currency feature itself as there is only a limited capped supply in existence. (Holding 2.7Gi makes you 1 in 1,000,000 globally.)


So, in this case, a real-world demand for a base *solution* drives global adoption of a protocol, IOTA, *behind the scenes*, which then leads to the mainstream ""booming"" of IOTA itself in the public consciousness thanks to the media.

dpwt92q,7dd396,"My advice that I had personally learnt while trading stocks is, don't look at the dollar value itself. Look at the percentage gains. 

The dollar value comes from how much you put down. But when you start looking at the percentage, it represents how well you are actually doing. It lets you learn and improve without emotions getting involved. 

Just because someone makes 10k in a day and another makes 1k, doesn't mean 10k is Better, it means that they had put more money down.
(1k may have had an initial investment of 500, which is 100% gain. 10k might have had a 33% increase with a 30k initial investment)

So my main advice is, start small, work your value of investment up slowly. Success doesn't come overnight. Keep practicing and learning while slowly increasing the value. You may have had good luck so far, but you never know when that can change. It's better to have knowledge than luck. I've learnt the hard way.

dpwy729,7dd35u,"There are issues with the technology if you just increase block size. It is the lazy short sighted solution. Every time you increase blocksize you leave out small miners because of the increased amount of storage space needed to house the blockchain. I guess this doesn't matter in BCH case because all of the mining is done by essentially one entity. And now it is creating a similar problem to what people are saying about segwit. If scaling blocksize is the only solution then eventually you have 1GB+ blocks that can only be mined and stored by mega factories. 

I'm no expert and I'm sure there are many other problems with just simply increasing blocksize. Im also not saying that we shouldn't ever increase blocksize either but it shouldn't be the go to solution for scaling. 

And to blindly back a claim that scaling blocksize is the only solution because you aren't paying fees right now is just shortsighted and unhealthily.

Blockchain naturally doesn't scale well, this is why we should stay vigilant in research to find teams behind projects that who will engineer a blockchain that addresses these issues.

In general, it is not logically sound to extrapolate from the historical growth rate into the indefinite future. For example, the 2010 update to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, predicted that growth would slow around 2013, and in 2015 Gordon Moore foresaw that the rate of progress would reach saturation: ""I see Moore's law dying here in the next decade or so.""",1510867919.0,1,kalakoi

If literally no one else were mining (and we didn't need to wait for a difficulty adjustment), my laptop would easily handle the entire number of bitcoin transactions equally as well as the current army of ASICs.

Where the difference comes in is security.  In the ""my laptop"" situation, anyone with ten laptops could come along and rewrite the blockchain pretty much at will simply by redoing my historical calculations along with the new ones and inserting different data in to the chain as they do so.  The more hash power put towards it, the more *secure* the chain is from this kind of attack.

This is the property of immutability bestowed by the concept of proof-of-work and is - in my opinion - a far more important aspect of bitcoin than the concept of a blockchain, which is what gets most of the press.

I'm aware that doesn't answer your question yet, but it's important to state in order to really give the following answer: Your question doesn't make sense.

Would they have to do a fork of LN too?",1510846271.0,1,Klutzkerfuffle
dpwu5cm,7dd2k1,"You have a transaction of your channel representing the current state. You can use that to close your channel on both chains separately (which would be the safest way because it prevents a replay attack). Or you could close the channel on one chain while continuing to use your channel on the other chain. So, in fact, LN channels are duplicated during the fork as well (with their latest state).

A problem can occur, if the hardfork changes the format of the transactions (eg. to implement replay protection). In that case your channel transactions maybe won't be usable on the new chain. Then you should close the channel before the fork or you have to trust your channel partner to close the unwanted chain channel cooperatively by creating a new closing transaction with you.

Or you spend all coins on the channel, then it's not your problem anymore.",1510847604.0,1,m-hi
dpwu8j8,7dd2k1,"Forking creates duplicate copies of the blockchain. So I imagine the LN channels would be duplicated too.

I can decide to close a channel after spending .5 of my 1 btc and I will get .5 back and the the other side of the channel will get their .5 I sent to them. I can do this at any time right?

So the best idea would be to close all my channels before the fork and reopen after the markets and both forks have calmed down.",1510847915.0,1,TheRetroGamingGuys
dpwvdp5,7dd2k1,"Yes. You can close a channel anytime without consent - except on a forked chain, that introduces a new transaction format. If it's prepared carefully, maybe you can get a new transaction in the new format before the fork if LN software gets this feature. Then you would be safe during and after the fork without needing to close the channel.

That means: LN software should give you two transactions representing the current channel state (one for each chain) before the fork. And if it doesn't in time, close the channel before the fork.

If there is no replay protection, you won't need this--but you are open to replay attacks. So it would be better to close the channel in case of such a fork (before or after doesn't matter but without making a new LN transaction after the fork).

Closing the channel before a fork is always the safest bet (but maybe not the cheapest).",1510848835.0,1,m-hi

This is about to get very interesting. The EDA has just kicked in and should continue lowering the difficulty over the next few days.

Eventually the difficulty could be walked very far down; unless some miners decide to mine it for the purpose of preventing the EDA from continuing.

Anyways if the difficulty is walked down to say 0.01% of current difficulty over the course of a few weeks; it would then be quite possible for Bitcoin Clashic block height to overtake BCH.

The EDA limits the adjustment to a maximum of 4x at every 2016 block interval.

So 0.01% even if 2016 blocks are mined in 10minutes would only adjust to 0.04%; then 0.16% ; 0.64% ; 2.5% ; 10%.

So they could mine 10,000 Blocks in a short amount of time before the difficulty gets close to the current BCH difficulty.

If Bitcoin Clashic gains even a tiny market share; enough that it becomes ""profitable"" given the EDA; then it is possible that it attracts more hashpower than BCH and overtakes total difficulty.

In the same way the BCH has been plotting a ""BTC death spiral"" because it would be in BCH's best interests; it is in BTC's best interest to snuff out this malicious chain. I believe there is a reasonable risk that once the EDA brings difficulty down to a profitable level we will actually see it siphon miners from BCH (they seem to switch to whatever is most profitable regardless of politics) ; and then it would only take a few % of the Bitcoin hashrate from BTC mining to have more hashrate on Clashic than BCH. 

This situation is honestly so perfect it almost feels like a false flag.

We have a major disagreement over Bitcoin improvement strategies; Move fast and break things; vs highly conservative development.

So we get a rash fork with a poorly thought through DAA. Eventually that poorly thought through fork is forced to fork again to upgrade its DAA. BCH being a short lived and highly centralized coin would be one of the easiest coins to undergo a quick hardfork over something nobody deems is contentious.

But then even with this simple non-contentious ""upgrade"" it proves to be a security risk that opens up an enormous attack surface.

I guess they contracted a third party to do it through escrow, like that’s supposed to change the economics somehow? 

So far this is a pretty solid “no thanks” in my book. ",1510852883.0,1,Darius510
dpwt29g,7dd05b,"And the price would drop an equal amount as a result of pumping up the supply to provide that liquidity. 

This is simple supply/demand. In order for it to grow as an investment you have to hold. The more people hold, the less liquid it is, the more they need to pump XRP in, the less scarce and valuable your XRP is. I’m seeing what could be a useful tool for B2B, but I’m not seeing an investment with growth potential. ",1510846493.0,1,Darius510
dpwu1cy,7dd05b,"That assumes demand can be met with the dollar value of all existing XRP. However, I know of no evidence or rationale to support that position. 

As it stands, forex markets have a daily volume of around $5trillion. If we make two assumptions: 

a) XRP would facilitate 1% of total forex trading. 

b) 20% of the total supply of XRP (20bn XRP or $5bn) is available to trade each day (I think that is a hugely generous assumption as it implies 1 in 5 XRP holders are actively trying to sell).

The market value of all XRP would have to be 10x greater than it is now to meet that demand. That demand for global exchange liquidity could not be met with the existing $25bn market value of all XRP. It just isn't possible.",1510847490.0,1,AlexanderSupersloth
dpwuprd,7dd05b,"No, it doesn’t assume that at all. Sure you cant do it with XRPs market value per coin. But increase the supply of XRP by 10x and the price per coin will remain stable while the market cap grows. 

What is stopping Ripple from doing that? With Bitcoin the rest of the network would simply not accept a software update that arbitrarily printed more BTC or raised the supply cap. But as long as Ripple is a private network and closed source software there’s nothing stopping them from turning the knob and basically seizing all of the incoming value from a rising market cap for themselves.

If you can prove to me that Ripple cannot arbitrarily inflate or otherwise control the price of XRP then I take it back. But I mean literal proof that they can’t do it, not just some statement or promise that they won’t. ",1510848166.0,1,Darius510

dpwwva9,7dd05b,"Ok, that’s a start. How much XRP does Ripple inc own? Does anyone have write access to the repository that doesn’t work for Ripple?",1510850294.0,1,Darius510
dpwwzu4,7dd05b,"They own 55% of the supply right now, or 55bn XRP. I included that XRP in my above assessment. Total XRP in existence is valued at $25bn.

I don't know who has write access to their repository. I doubt anyone other than Ripple. The protocol was distributed amongst 55 different validators as of July. ",1510850420.0,2,AlexanderSupersloth

dpwxbw2,7dd05b,"No new XRP are created. The cap on supply as per the protocol is 100bn. All those XRP already exist.

As an AML investigator, I will have access to the entire blockchain - no need for pesky and time consuming subpeonas and warrants. If the account application lists the source of funds as ""salary from my employer"", then I can look for BTC flowing into the address from that employer's account. If I don't see that, I can ask why not. 

This already happens today with analog currency deposits, but with much, much less efficiency.  *Know your customer* rules all-of-a-sudden become frictionless once you can expose the entire blockchain to analytics. 

The alternative, of course, is to keep the BTC out of a regulated institution. But that will restrict the pool of potential counterparties where those funds will be accepted. Anyone who wants to play in the ""sunshine"" economy will have to maintain their trust score or else will face sanctions.

Bitcoin is there for the American people when it appears that a foreign government has influenced their presidential election, and it will be there fore them when the next president is forced to retaliate.

Bitcoin is there for every person in a corrupt country when the taxman or the court decide they need a little extra.  For the 3am raid, for the coup d'etat, for to soldier on TV warning you to ""please remain calm"".

In the near future (6mo -- 3 yrs) you're going to see a lot of institutions struggling to buy into crypto. A fuckton of enterprise money is going to be invested in large chunks all over the place. Banks see the writing on the wall, and need to hedge their bets to find alternate value stores (besides securities, gold, commodities, and fiat currency)

BTC is very scarce. Truly, there's not a lot of trade-able or salable BTC. Maybe 100,000 -- the rest are in cold storage, in deep hard hands (hodlers), or lost. If you're an institutional investor, Bitcoin looks solid. Demand is high and will grow. Supply is low. This is why I believe the hyper-monetization of Bitcoin will continue for a while.

XRP on the other hand is as available as Ripple wants it to be. Sure, its going to release (sell) it in such a way to cultivate the company and the platform, but that doesn't necessarily mean the value will continue to go up.

In my other thread u/BigFriendlyGaybro also raised a couple of good points, see below:

OK, if this were any other blockchain company, sure, I'd let those points sit and do their thing, but come on.

""As far as I understand, Ripple inc still owns most of the XRP, and they can always print more.""

First of all, there's an escrow lock up of 55BILLION XRP planned for within the next 6 weeks. So the majority of XRP will not be owned by anyone, it will slowly get released into the market at a rate of 1 Billion per month and whatever of that 1Bil doesn't get bought up from the escrow, it will return right back.

Second, they can't ""print"" more, its maximum supply was and will never surpass 100BILLIONXRP, and in fact since it's a deflationary asset that burns with each transaction as an anti spam mechanism, it will only go lower (currently, Max supply is somewhere in the 99BILLION range)

""If Ripple inc is in trouble those two factors are a huge red flag that they will throw XRP owners under the bus if it benefits them.""

^Yeah sure, they have a 300,000,000USD worth of XRP for a launch program incentive and they have to worry about being in financial trouble /s...these guys have the backing of the GATES FOUNDATION and GOOGLE VENTURES. This isn't some random blockchain startup they've been around for over 5 years and have over 100 banking and payments partners.....you have to stop narrowing the possibilities and realize that this is a full blown company, no longer is it just a startup.

The reason they don't want people using this as a speculative investment is because it's a LIQUIDITY PROVIDER. So they don't want dumbasses buying and selling this at the drop of a dime, they want this to remain in use by a market that actually seeks to make use of the coin. That doesn't mean people doing so hurts it, they'd just prefer that their invention get used for its actual purpose.

Also wtf, have people forgotten that the price of XRP has increased like 30x since January??? How the fuck is this a bad investment

Regardless, I don't see that as a bad thing, necessarily. Since the 60-70% they hold isn't actually in circulation it would become very apparent very quickly if they released it but didn't say anything, which would tank their system and its value as holders and businesses (presumably, at least) lose trust and drop out. That's no good for them.

What's more- if they release it publicly (as they are supposed to) in an even *apparently* manipulative way (or just stupid, or both) it would have a similar effect, harming their company and their token (as well as the platform it's on).

* As far as I understand, Ripple inc still owns most of the XRP, and they can always print more.

With a typical blockchain the founders/operators are in the same boat as users/ investors. But that equity isn’t there with XRP. If Ripple inc is in trouble those two factors are a huge red flag that they will throw XRP owners under the bus if it benefits them. 

That said I think the importance of leadership, whether through influential individuals or corporate stewardship is WAY underestimated by the average crypto investor. Democracies are a way to decentralize power within govts and you can’t find a functioning nation in the world that doesn’t have a president or prime minister. Decentralization is good but total decentralization has never worked. Even the best example we have of a functioning decentralized network (the internet) still has leadership, governance and institutions to keep things from falling apart over disagreements.

This is how I see it, the coin XRP which you are buying has a certain value atm. Most altcoins have a value too so what exactly happens? It goes up and down right?
Why? I hear you. Because of demand and supply, when demand is high price goes up and when there is less demand price goes down.

Ok good, so what does that have to do with my question?
The value which we talked about goes up when there is more demand. The demand goes up when there is good news for example. A good example is: Bank X now officially makes use of XRP and accepts it as a form of payment ( this is of course HUGE news probably unrealistic as well but Im ust trying to show you postive news ). When this news comes out, people are like wow! I need this coin because the bank is using it so it must be worth a lot! They buy, and price goes up. Now if you had bought some xrp beforehand because you knew this was a good project you now have made profit if you decide to sell.

""As far as I understand, Ripple inc still owns most of the XRP, and they can always print more.""

First of all, there's an escrow lock up of 55BILLION XRP planned for within the next 6 weeks. So the majority of XRP will not be owned by anyone, it will slowly get released into the market at a rate of 1 Billion per month and whatever of that 1Bil doesn't get bought up from the escrow, it will return right back.

Second, they can't ""print"" more, its maximum supply was and will never surpass 100BILLIONXRP, and in fact since it's a deflationary asset that burns with each transaction as an anti spam mechanism, it will only go lower (currently, Max supply is somewhere in the 99BILLION range)

""If Ripple inc is in trouble those two factors are a huge red flag that they will throw XRP owners under the bus if it benefits them.""

^Yeah sure, they have a 300,000,000USD worth of XRP for a launch program incentive and they have to worry about being in financial trouble /s...these guys have the backing of the GATES FOUNDATION and GOOGLE VENTURES. This isn't some random blockchain startup they've been around for over 5 years and have over 100 banking and payments partners.....you have to stop narrowing the possibilities and realize that this is a full blown company, no longer is it just a startup.

The reason they don't want people using this as a speculative investment is because it's a LIQUIDITY PROVIDER. So they don't want dumbasses buying and selling this at the drop of a dime, they want this to remain in use by a market that actually seeks to make use of the coin. That doesn't mean people doing so hurts it, they'd just prefer that their invention get used for its actual purpose.

Each month, they will release 1 BILLION FROM THE ESCROW onto the market, whatever amount doesn't get bought from that goes directly back into the escrow at the end of the month, so if none of it gets bought it stays out of circulation and the value of the coin itself does not move. There is no constant in terms of numbers here for you to even create those percentages, if someone buys up half a billion from the escrow but the rest goes back, then the supply goes up half a billion that month and the price remains the same because someone most likely bought it at market value and therefore the market cap goes up without anything else going down.

MARKETS WORK ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND. To assume that that would drop the value assumes that there will be no demand for this new billion xrp/month.

Bro:

1) Have you really not been paying attention to Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past year and a half? If so, you have to worry about that as a possible reality while investing in crypto in general unless it's made to combat that in the first place (which, is a BRAND NEW semi mainstream nuance being implemented in development unless you're talking VTC)

2) They literally have a mapped out plan to not only lock up THE MAJORITY OF ALL EXISTING XRP in an escrow but also

3) THEY HAVE A NODE DECENTRALIZATION SCHEDULE https://ripple.com/insights/how-we-are-further-decentralizing-the-ripple-consensus-ledger-rcl-to-bolster-robustness-for-enterprise-use/ And apparently that starts in 2018.

4) In developing blockchain, you can have 2 of 3 things. Security, Scalability, Decentralization. They perfected Security (hence, ya know, BANKS) and Scalability (as of July, it constantly handles 1500 transactions per second, in tests it handles up to 50,000tps, or about the same as Visa https://ripple.com/xrp/ <- but don't believe me, here's a link). So their next step is further decentralization

5) XRP is not as fragile of a software as BTC or ETH, Ripple's software for all of this has gone through 80 UPDATES and its only fork was Lumens AND IT'S GETTING USED BY IBM.

Pffft this shit is open source and viewable my guy, in so many ways.

dpxlv0h,7dcvl3,"...wow ok yeah when I said you can't read earlier is was meant to be a joke at your expense not a twice proven reality.

What do you mean give it to someone else to slowly sell?

Ripple cannot access any of the XRP in the goddamn Escrow. And even when that 1 billion comes out, it's for exchanges, banks, businesses, and investors. They don't buy it or have someone else sell it. They have a smart contract that lets out some out into the open to be grabbed at by any and all who happen to want it and be present.

Or do you expect them to somehow lock up all 55billion permanently and effectively just burn it without actually burning it?

How else would you have liked for them to distribute the XRP? You love to point out non issues as if they're problems but what solutions do you suggest based on these other coins that you must love for their deeply able code and their current functionality?",1510875416.0,2,BigFriendlyGaybro
dpxgo4y,7dcvl3,"Last quarter they sold 0.2% of total volume in XRP, if you wanted an idea of how careful they are. It was a lot considering the high volume, but they're not flash dumping.

dpxamhp,7dcvl3,"Does Costco dump paper towel prices when they sell in bulk?

Bitcoin has a mechanism to lock up funds and release them over time as well, which we're nearing the end of. Lots of tokens are also having founders hold a portion so they can retain something like equity in their company and protocol. It's not really abnormal, what they're doing. It's a strategy.

So either we don't believe they're intending to make billions off banks, or we believe they are. The rest is left up to their execution.

Again, I'm not saying this is a coin you should base the foundation of a portfolio on. I am saying holding some would be a good idea. Your 10 dollars in ripple could be worth 1000 dollars some day. A gain is a gain.

You're also protecting yourself from the future cryptocurrency market, what direction it will take. It could be that most of the world's money moves to more centralized blockchains as regulations are smacked down nation by nation. Maybe the banks win some day and we're left with anonymous coins that only black market participants and far-right libertarians use.

Wallstreet and Banks have a TON of money and influence. A rational person, seeing how history plays out time after time, would put some dollars on their continued dominance.",1510863486.0,5,JoinXorDie

dpxlyib,7dcvl3,"Why did they need to distribute it in the first place?

dpxhlmb,7dcvl3,"Flash dumping would destabilize it. I’m sure they’re smart enough to avoid doing that. But again, it doesn’t devalue the currency any less when they dump it slowly. It possible that the nominal price can still go up while they’re selling, but all that means is it would have gone up even higher if they weren’t dumping. The math on this is incredibly simple - if they’re doubling the amount of XRP in circulation, by the time they’re finished the value of everyone else’s XRP will be worth half as much as it otherwise would be. 

Over the next 5 years they’re going to take half your gains. And you’re cool with that? It’s probably the biggest instamine crypto has and ever will see. 

And that’s assuming you gain at all. Whatever it sits at will be half of what it would have been. You’re getting all of the risk and only half of the gains. How the hell is that a fair deal?",1510870499.0,1,Darius510
dpxmt0n,7dcvl3,"OK wow we've reached the peak of what?

Why did they need to distribute in the first place? Oh Idk... why would you ever distribute any kind of coin...not like you want anyone to be able to use or hold it right?.../s

They distributed it for the same reason a farmer distributes his goods to the market even if his main goal is super markets. Investment and purchase both create value and market the actual currency. It's not a difficult concept son.

They also didn't distribute the majority of the XRP in existence, they've been incredibly careful not to throw around crazy volumes of the stuff or even sell all that much unless it was intended for use rather than investment.

Also, no, it's not about how many are in circulation it's about what orders exist and what prices they're for. The market is not some magical calculator that keeps multiple constants for no reason.

The price is the average of all the orders. So the more scarce something becomes, or the harder to get something becomes, or the more used and useful something becomes, the more its value increases because people will literally ask to buy it at a certain price or seek to sell it at a certain price. If the price stays the same because demand doesn't change and nobody buys any of those billion xrp, they go right back into the escrow and are put at the back of the line to come out again in 55 months time. If they all get bought, let's say at 25 cents, and XRP already costs 25 cents, then despite the addition of this new XRP to the supply, the price will remain the same because the average of all orders will remain around 25 cents. The market cap will simply go up, the price will remain stagnant, and the supply will increase.

It is NOT that complicated.

Also, the reason why this escrow is brilliant is because eventually, there won't be enough xrp on the market to satiate new customers coming in, and they will clearly offer to buy it at a higher price because of the money it's bound to save them (apparently up to 60% on ForEx with use of XRP on Xrapid) so it actually helps drive up the price and create more liquidity for the whole system naturally rather than based on speculation.",1510876527.0,2,BigFriendlyGaybro

To help you out - there used to be a worthless bitcoin in circulation, and then thousands of worthless bitcoin in circulation and then hundreds of thousands of cheap bitcoin eventually leading to millions of very expensive bitcoins. The cryptocurrency scene is a rising market. 

Your assumption of inflation in supply leading to deflation in price may be correct if the market wasn't a bull market and XRP wasn't constantly adding utility to their coin as well as well as having the drive to find financial institutions to use that utility.

It's up to you who you want to trust with your investments, but a lot of people choose ripple because it's the one that's acting most like a business, they have by far the best infrastructure (150+ employees), and they stand to lose much more than the XRP holders if XRP markets aren't healthy.",1510870878.0,2,GhatiaPoisson

That said, I don't think the devs really thought through all the economic implications or market forces.

If both coins are more or less equally profitable, then miners are likely jsut going to mine the coin they actually believe in. And judgine by the fact that when BCH was less profitable under the old EDA it got like, 2% of all hashpower, that suggests miners aren't interested in it unless they can use it as a piggy bank to raid from time to time.

Bitcoin Cash Flippening Cannot Happen Now.

If more hash power moves to the Bitcoin Cash BCH chain, and blocks are found quicker, the NEW mining algorithm will automatically adjust to make it more difficult to mine Bitcoin Cash. As it becomes more difficult to mine, miners will move back to Bitcoin BTC. Bitcoin Cash own mining algorithm is extremely bullish for Bitcoin BTC.

The new DAA is designed to keep BCHs hashpower roughly equivalent to its price ratio with BTC.  If you want BCH to ""kill"" BTC it has to be done in the market.

I believe that BTC fees will continue to prevent the ""chain death spiral"" at least until the majority of liquid Bitcoins are on exchange.  At that point it's anyone's guess if it's possible.

Edit: what I mean by this is... you have a lot of Bitcoins that will never move for various reasons including the owner isn't following political events in Bitcoin and / or believes BTC to always win no matter what.  There are plenty of people holding big bags of coins that were in at under $10 who won't even wake up until Bitcoin crashes all the way to the floor.  *Everyone else* that would be willing to sell their Bitcoins in a price event represents the price makers.  For chain death to potentially happen, enough of these people must already be in a position to sell (ie coins already on exchange) for the price to collapse *in spite of the onchain coins being frozen*.  If these people aren't already on exchange, then when the event occurs they either can't dump their coins (supporting BTC price) or pay exorbitant fees to do so, correcting the mining incentive.

In other words, ironically, only once we start to have BTC price & hashpower losses that *don't* result in a fee market explosion, then the flippening / tippening ""chain death"" could possibly happen, because there will not be fees to pay for more blocks to be mined.",1510847397.0,17,jessquit

- You start to set buy order at higher than market price, let the other people believing that the price is going up for a good reason;
- After you have triggered the upward spiral, you let the market go on, and when the buying orders finishes, you'll dump all the coins you previously purchased at an higher price.

- Who ride the pump&dump: smart investors which recognizes what's going on and will try to have a slice of the profit;

I'm really struggling to find your rationale. Saving isn't a *rational* choice. If a rational person were given the option of setting fire to $1 or being given $0.50, they would chose the option that gives them money over the option that costs them money. Saving 0.5% when there is 2% inflation does not result in *any* benefit for the saver. It costs them money. The choice to save is not rational. Non rational choices should not be considered as realistic choices. If we're going to discuss other irrational things that people could do, but say that they totally count as realistic options, then I guess people could also have the choice to deposit all of their money into an actual tire fire.

dpx6ho4,7dckyh,"It's not a matter of ""inflation"". Since 1980, the US stock market has had around 8 or 9 crashes, which for stocks means dips of 20% or more. 8 or 9, over 37 years. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has had nearly as many 60% dips in the 7 years it's existed, and countless 20% dips (two in the last three months). Does that mean Bitcoin is going to crash? No, but it's much, much more volatile than US stocks. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and if it were going up at similar rates it would probably be less volatile. But compared to other asset classes, there's a much higher chance of you being down 50% on a given day.

Risk mitigation just means having a mixture of less volatile and more volatile assets. This is an extremely smart thing to do. Any given investor has a certain level of risk vs reward tradeoff they're most comfortable with. As it turns out, balancing less risky but lower returning assets with more risky and higher returning assets lets you get higher expected return with lower expected risk than a homogenous portfolio could.

Now if for some reason you have no risk sensitivity, you're fine with losing everything, then might as well just go to Las Vegas. Otherwise, stay diversified in accordance with your personal risk aversion.",1510859482.0,6,45d31878e71846a9c28d

dpxlj2x,7dciij,"Awesome question fam, I'm a lil stoned so I'm gonna give you a long answer and I hope you understand it all serves to give you the best context possible for my understanding and opinion ok?

So I'll start with this:

If an inventor hasn't sold his invention on the market, does it not yet have a use?

The fact of the matter is that XRP is ready to go, it's always being updated like any utility (internet, cable, even your browsers like comodo, chrome, and firefox) but it's completely and totally ready. It's meant to be a bridge currency on a network, so in essence, the only thing creating or hindering its value is its actual announced use and market demand.

Here's the thing though. What sucks for us investors is that their markets are Banks. (That's also what's awesome for us, more on that in a bit). But specifically for this really young market of investors, we have no patience and we want absolute transparency at all times.

When you deal with Banks, the public will NOT have that until such time that it affects them via the bank's direct action.

However, what they plan to do, and have clearly been on track to create is the answer to your question, aka XRP's use.

1) Liquidity
2) Settlement
3) Ease of Transfer

It basically plans to be the underpinning value of all international transfer of electronic money. As of now, its ability at the most conservatively reported by the most recent tests is 50,000 Transactions per second, or as scalable as Visa.

They've run tests all the fuck over the world. From Siam to Zug they've had all sorts of test cases and use cases, between Federal/Central Banks and large enterprises, between federal governments and banking apps. It all works, and works well. 180Million dollars went from a swiss bank to a canadian bank, and settled, all in under 6 seconds. They did a transfer between the Siam Commercial bank in Thailand and SBI in Japan, it settled in 4 seconds.

We're actually just waiting on USE announcements. We have all the adoption, test cases, proven functionality and excitement we need, after all if you look at my above comment you should be just as hyped as I am. Especially with the articles that came out after that summit they had, banks are SERIOUS about this shit. I also didn't even mention:

1) The devs of ILP are working in tandem with Hyperledger (ILP is the base software made by Ripple that provides the functionality of connecting ledgers, literally the Inter Ledger Protocol) here's their member list https://hyperledger.org/members (you may see some familiar *coughAMEXcough* faces)

2) Codius, aka upcoming smart contracts. Yes, the same thing that gives ETH its potential is coming to XRP, there's even rumors of compatibility already being coded in for the both of them so that XRP and ETH smart contracts can function across each other or even to mirror each other.

3) They have PLANNED Q4 Announcements for new XRP customer Banks, Businesses, and Payments Providers aside from just Cuallix.

4) Did I mention that they have a partnership with DAYLI in South Korea aka the people working on South Korea's NEO/XRP hybrid?

5) They have people from Ripple's employee base working on an API for online marketplaces. This API is headed up by the W3C or the World Wide Web Consortium, https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List 

So what I mean to say is, its use case is that it is to date and by actual use, adoption, and readiness, the most scalable and interoperable crypto in this whole mess and that it will soon gain more uses and has room for even more improvement because it has mastered its primary vertical of foreign exchange and is such a robust and flexible stack of goddamn solid code.

A lot of us understand the signs of the market, and that's the beautiful thing about working with banks at this capacity, THERE'S GONNA BE A SHITTON OF INCOMING MONEY. But also consider this, it's not just banks, it's payments. Amazon, eBay, AirBnB, Facebook Marketplace, Exchanges, Credit Card Companies, Bill Pay Companies, Contract Services, Loans, Real Estate........so in fact, that 100,000,000,000 total supply doesn't scare me one bit either.

1/ The TRUTH behind @VitalikButerin's child porn tweet, deletion, and subsequent cover up. (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOuWhK7VwAARgHf.jpg)

2/ Before, I begin I'd like to state that I don't believe Vitalik realistically supports child porn legalization, he was speaking in hypotheticals. However, I do believe this is a great example pf his immaturity, poor judgement, and political nature.

3/ Traits that manifest themselves in Ethereum's fatally flawed design and completely arbitraty governance culture. Consider this a TRIGGER WARNING for large ETH investors that have been duped by the Vitalik cult of personality.

4/ Oh yeah, DISCLOSURE: I recently entered into a short ETH/BTC position once I realized how fallible Vitalik is and how the false narrative that he's super rational and infallible keeps the  ETH charade going. A project that has raised billions w/o shipping anything that works.

5/ To understand the present, you need to understand the past. Everything in ETHlandia went wrong after the infamous DAO hack. (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOuYy_bUIAAPoiP.jpg)

6/ The DAO was an economically and technically flawed project that assumed the crowd could pool ETH and vote on projects that would generate cashflow returns and increase the value of the ETH ecosystem. aka ""the wisdom of the crowd"" aka ""socialism"".

7/ The boy Genius actually invested in this economicslly incoherent idea revealing how little he knows about real world economics. The economic illiteracy here was only overshadowed by the technical illiteracy.

8/ This was revealed when the DAO ""hacker"" exploited a vulnerability in the code that allowed her to withdraw millions of dollar in ether invested in the DAO to a child DAO she controlled.

9/ The Ethereum platform was marketed as a platform that creates ""unstoppable applications"" impervious to censorship because ""code is law.""

10/ However, when Vitalik and his friends that invested in the DAO's money was on the line as well as they're planned future transition to ""proof of stake,"" they decided to reneg on their marketing promises and censor the hackers transaction by the forking protocol...

11/ and stealing the hackers rightly owned funds (she just executed the code) to return to dumb investors creating a precedent for protocol censorship, bailouts, and moral hazard.

12/ More critically, Vitalik implicated that he was the leader of Ethereum and that it was indeed centralized by single handedly getting exchanges to halt trading to stop the hacker from liquidating. (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOubo3YU8AI86bR.jpg)

13/ Vitalik was able to manipulate the trading of what the SEC later called a security. Also accordingly to the SEC, if ETH was created today, it too would also be considered a security. Lucky for them, unlike the DAO, the SEC can arbitrarily enforce rules. (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOucgnqUQAAkbEc.jpg)

14/ Subsequent to that fiasco. It was revealed that Vitalik had been taking meetings with Vladimir Putin and created a joint venture with a state-owned bank called Ethereum Russia. Which shows how painfully naive Vitalik is or that he has underlying geopolitical motives. (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOudhjkVwAA2f_g.jpg & https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOudhD4UMAAdrRs.jpg)

15/ The reason Satoshi remained anoynomous and the Bitcoin community touts decentralization is to discourage central points of failure that can be leveraged to alter the protocol. Vitalik set a dangerous precedent that he had that power to change things with the DAO hack. (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOufAWXVoAEyyMn.jpg)

16/ Fast forward to today, I began my crusade to expose the malicious and incompetent actors that were attacking Bitcoin to serve their interests. Namely @coinbase investors and employees.

17/ Turns out they and their company were heavily invested in ETH's success which creates an inherent conflict of interest when influencing the internal affairs of the Bitcoin community. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOugXJAV wAE0KHq.jpg & (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOugXsLVQAA8vNM.jpg & https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOugYFnVAAA24zL.jpg & https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOugYbPVAAAmknA.jpg)

18/ Mind you during this forking debate, the Ethereum community was having major and maybe fatal setbacks with coming SEC ICO crackdown (eth's killer app) and the Parity Hack that conjured up the centralized bailout moral hazard precedent again. (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOuhkFUVwAAGMJ_.jpg & https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOuhkqnVAAAogq6.jpg & https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOuhlVWVwAALPwq.jpg)

19/ After succesfully repelling the 2X ""attack."" The BCash attack ramped up. I tirelessly attempted to inform the public about the illegitimacy of the Bitcoin fork by keying on the unethical and illegal behavior of the Bcash team. (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOuiaBVVAAAfu8O.jpg & https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOuiaUMVAAIAWQN.jpg & https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOuia-nUMAA893L.jpg)

20/ Vitalik, in what I assume was an attempt to divert attention from Ethereum problems and spite Bitcoin, proceeded to ""congratulate"" the BCH team for pumping their market cap pass ETH's. (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOujRluUEAAZ-c1.jpg & https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOujR_wVAAAmpHJ.jpg)

dpwoeel,7dchtg,"For the record, I do NOT feel it is fair to get on to VB about the 'possession of Child Porn' comment. However, it was an 'odd' argument altogether.

His statement was that TAKING drugs SHOULD be illegal cause you harm yourself, and indirectly society.

His follow up statement is that POSSESSION of Child Porn harms no one, is thus should not carry penalties.

This effectively delves into deep thoughts of governance, and likewise you must also understand reprimands. If the punishment for 'taking drugs' is 'prison', then you have harmed society 3 fold. Once by the Drugs, Once by the Prison Time, and once by Taxing people to pay for Prisons.

And the other part is 'when is enough, enough' work. If you work successfully 40 hours a week, should you be permitted a drug habit? If you work 5 hours a week... or 60 hours?

The root of the suggestion, however, is that we are all dependent upon each other, as individuals, to make positive actions for society. And then likewise, so long as you accept the 'perpetual state of war' mentality, then effectively our lives become jeopardized through the inclusion of the weak and derelict within our sphere of protection.

So the question might be poised that, if 'self harm' is become criminalized, why is not avoiding 'self improvement' likewise criminalized. Should TV watchers go to Jail? Should book reading be mandatory? Etc, etc.

So, in the end, though I think the 'logic' that each individual has an onus to maximize their abilities for consistent protection for all is valid, I question the methods used by modern day legality, and thus would discourage calling it illegal, or no more so than TV watching should be criminalized as well.

In modern world, Businesses are a form of 'exclusive' society, in which all must contribute & are rewarded 'fairly', but in that context you merely lose leadership, income, inclusion, etc... for various forms of laziness, never jailed, and rarely fined.

I do fully agree that possession of (virtually) anything should not be a crime. Possession laws are completely arbitrary, and are only used to slander when times are convenient. They are by no means evenly applied, which makes them poor forms of law.",1510841112.0,-1,kybarnet

dpx42cv,7dchtg,"ETH has a lot of issues, but they all effectively amount to same criticism which Nick mentioned at the start : Centralized Leadership & Economic Incentives.

Nick criticized ETH hard for taking 'ICO' money, vs propagating the coin via miners & developers, exclusively. Now, granted, I don't think ICO money is 'bad', BUT the manifestations have presented themselves.

Even today, no matter how 'decentralized' ETH is promoted to be, ~70% of the Marketing is exclusively Vitalik, ~95% of Decision making is exclusively an unelected body of Core Devs (with little to no transparency) or you could say a 'royal commission', and ownership of ETH is easily 30% to 50% within the hands of like 15 people.

This has lead to a rash of poor decisions, and political thought processes. BTC avoided this by not allowing ICO money, which effectively lead to a more disperse marketing team, and likewise the 'Core Devs' are fairly easily rebuked, so effectively they must be 'elected' (in some regard) - as the marketing team is dispersed, and then finally the distribution of BTC was initially (and subsequently) VERY widely distributed vs ETH, meaning that 'profiteering' motives, and pump and dumps, benefit more than simply very, very few people.

Where as ETH might be 50% consolidated, BTC is likely 15 to 30% consolidated. The less consolidated your coin, the better chance it has of replacing 'gold', which is the highest level of functionality for a crypto (at least initially). Of all the coins, BTC is the least consolidated (that I know of), and thus is has the property more than any other.

For someone to attempt to 'reconsolidate' BTC at this point, it would require like a $50 Bil buy order... which would just make the prices astronomical, etc. The cheapest, and biggest negative, to BTC is that you can do this simpler through mining copyright + power, which is likely what is happening now.",1510857167.0,0,kybarnet

There are some numbers about this from crowdsale in the blog article below.

*Source:* https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/08/ether-sale-a-statistical-overview/

> Given that Gini coefficients in the real world measure inequality of access to resources, and Gini coefficients in cryptocurrency distribution arise from both inequality of resources and inequality of interest (some people care about Ethereum slightly, some care about it a whole lot), 0.836 is a pretty decent result – as a point of comparison, the Gini coefficient of Bitcoin has been measured at 0.877. The top 100 current ETH holders are responsible for 45.7% of all ETH, a lower percentage than the top 100 holders of the mainstream altcoins, where that statistic tends to be between 55% and 70%.",1510858554.0,2,alsomahler
dpxfcrn,7dchtg,"you guys are hilarious. Look at Eth distribution of wallets here, and understand that the eth in wallets such as Polo is owned by a huge number of people. https://etherscan.io/accounts Notice how nowhere near 50% is even in the top 25 wallets, Including exchanges. Hard to argue that 50% is in the hands of 15 or 25 people when Vitalik only have himself 1% of Ether supply. And has since given away some of those coins to the foundation.

For your statement to be true, there would have to be 50-100 people with more Ether than Vitalik. He currently only holds about 0.5% of supply. At least use realistic numbers. I used to respect your opinion, you used to give facts Kybar. I have upvoted you many times on Ethtrader. 

 Eth is very decentralized. Eth foundation gets to make decisions because the community trusts them and no issues major enough have arisen enough to justify a split since the DAO. 

Vitalik has made it clear that all forks are fine, and he encourages it. So any team/faction is free to do whatever they want with the eth code. Market can decide. BTC is not taking the same approach to BCH, which is very disheartening. 

Vitalik defends BCH because in his eyes it is a legitimate fork, in the same way he acknowledges all forks as legit. And he is a big blocker. Which tells alot imo. 

Eth foundation has done nothing to lose the faith of the community. If at any point they lose that, that can change very quick. That is decentralized. And Eth nodes are more diversified than BTC nodes, geographically. These are all facts. ",1510868157.0,4,PsyRenity

Might shock you to know than none of the companies publicly paying devs and allowing them to work on bitcoin core actually ask them to do anything. In fact contract for blockstream employees stipulates that they can't. So not only does blockstream or mit labs or chaincode have no say in it but also the individuals with commit access won't refuse any commit if it has consensus from the wider core developer community.

Not too mention that if the goals of any of those devs was to make money, spending their time on OSS is probably the worse possible ROI they could have not too menti. However (at least regarding blockstream), their incentives are aligned since they also partially get paid in Bitcoin.

You don't have to trust me, the development is open source, go to the mailing list (https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev), check the closed/merged/opened PR & issues (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin), you'll see that it's actually very open and scientifically led especially compared to any alternatives out there. But of course It's not perfect: very hard to get consensus rules changes into code base since you need to prove very wide community consensus and there's no guided/documented process to do that afaik.

Looking at liquidity in transactions (how much value measured in fiat that moves in the last 24h) is also interesting but can be gamed by the same entities that can game order books.

However, the bitcoin days destroyed compared with order book volume could be an interesting metric as it would tell us if users are scrambling to run to/from exchanges or if the order book volumes are solely off-chain. It has nothing with dominance index though.

1000 tps is possible on the same hardware, with software improvements (multithreading and parallel validation).

The Bitcoin hasn't been designed to operate like this, and whenever I understand that this is the only way to have the BCH to survive (it would have died right after the fork otherwise), I'm critic against the method used: you need to convince adopters that something is good, you don't have to keep a coin alive artificially and then hope that one day it will be recognized.

Traders eagerly awaiting the debut of bitcoin futures will face tougher risk standards says the chief executive of the CME Group as the exchange operator plans to launch contracts on the highly volatile cryptocurrency.

Terry Duffy, CME chief executive, told the Financial Times he wants to lure a new generation of futures traders attracted by the cryptocurrency boom, although he acknowledges the challenges of creating a market infrastructure that can safely handle the hair-raising swings of bitcoin.

That may entail traders of CME bitcoin futures having to deposit close to 30 per cent of their value as collateral, says Mr Duffy, who is competing with a rival offering from Chicago neighbour, Cboe Global Markets.

The exchanges’ moves represent a first step by traditional institutions to take a serious look at a cryptocurrency, often associated with money-laundering and cyber theft. There are, however, worries that the launch exposes new risks to important financial bodies such as clearing houses that guarantee futures markets. 

“Listen, it’s no mystery, this is a different product,” says Mr Duffy. “We want to get out something that’s safe.” 

At CME, no bitcoin futures trading will be permitted at prices 20 per cent above or below the prior day’s settlement, according to exchange literature. That is similar to its circuit breakers for stock-index futures.

CME will also require bitcoin futures traders to post greater margin, or good-faith collateral, held against a losing position. “The margin is yet to be decided, but it’s not going to be standard futures margin. This margin is probably going to be closer to 30 per cent,” Mr Duffy says. Typical futures margins are in single-digit percentages. 

Some are concerned about the dangers posed by such a market to massive clearing houses that help curtail systemic risk.

Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers, this week took out a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal to argue that bitcoin futures endangered the CME clearing house where his company has money at stake as a member. He urged regulators to require separate, ringfenced clearing houses for cryptocurrencies. 

“Margining such a product in a reasonable manner is impossible,” Mr Peterffy wrote, adding that “a large cryptocurrency price move that destabilises members that clear cryptocurrencies will destabilise the clearing organisation itself”. 

Prices for the two rivals’ bitcoin futures will be based on spot bitcoin transactions at cryptocurrency exchanges whose record raises concern among financiers.

CME intends to use the CME CF bitcoin Reference Rate, a daily dollar price of bitcoin derived from prices at four bitcoin exchanges: Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken.

Six bitcoin exchanges underpinned the index as recently as April, when CME removed the Bitfinex and OKCoin exchanges after banks blocked their customers from wiring dollars in and out. 

Last year, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex lost more than $60m worth of bitcoin to hackers and was fined by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission “for offering illegal off-exchange financed retail commodity transactions in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” and failing to register. A message sent to Bitfinex chief executive J L van der Velde received no response. 

San Francisco-based Kraken yesterday told customers its platform was seeing slow response times, connection timeouts and delays in withdrawals. A CME official says the problems did not interrupt the calculation of its bitcoin rate. Kraken did not respond to queries. 

John Lothian, a former futures trader and broker who publishes a markets newsletter, says of CME’s venture: “They’re giving legitimacy to bitcoin and to these exchanges. They’re sharing their credibility with them. Whether they will be hurt by this or whether they profit by this is yet to be seen.” 

The Cboe contract will be based on bitcoin auction prices at Gemini Trust, a New York-based cryptocurrency exchange. “The Gemini bitcoin auction is an incredible liquidity event for bitcoin,” says John Deters, Cboe chief strategy officer. 

Yet Don Wilson, chief of DRW, a leading derivatives and cryptocurrencies trader, expressed concern about Gemini at a futures industry conference in Chicago last month. “Some of the auctions are pretty thinly traded,” he says, noting a recent one did not take place. A person close to Gemini blamed a glitch that has been fixed.

Acrimony over $232m ICO set to intensify regulatory scrutiny
The Big Read: Silicon Valley’s cryptocurrency boom
Articles from the FT’s Alphaville’s ICOmedy series
Most banks and asset managers have avoided the $120bn bitcoin market, given its intense volatility and evolving mechanics. Vincent Viola, founder of Virtu Financial, another proprietary trading group, says: “We have stayed away from bitcoin at Virtu . . . we didn’t understand it enough and it wasn’t regulated enough.” 

However, futures industry executives say if any venues are able to handle the gyrations of bitcoin it is futures exchanges, which routinely manage contracts that make cryptocurrencies seem tame, such as electricity derivatives. 

“The industry has long experience with managing volatility and managing products that move around a lot,” says Carl Gilmore, president of Integritas Financial Consulting, who formerly led futures clearing firms. 

Mr Duffy also sees bitcoin as a way of finding another generation of customers. 

“I . . . look at it as a client-acquisition play,” he says. “There’s clients who trade our products, but may not trade as often, who are intrigued by this. There’s a lot of young people that will like this type of marketplace, and they don’t even know what futures are today.” ",1510845686.0,2,101111

You can try using the excuse ""lost my Trezor in a boating accident"" but judges have heard that shit long before bitcoin existed. It used to be ""all of my cash was in a box and I lost it in a boating accident"".

The judge will laugh at you and tell you to pay anyway because you can't prove you actually spent or lost the money. They'll garnish your wages. You might say ""then I won't have a job and I'll just live off of my secret bitcoins"". Right, until a private investigator sees that you've been spending money you haven't earned and notify the courts and the IRS, who will come and take your stuff away. And thanks to the open ledger nature of bitcoin, they can just watch your wallet address like a hawk and wait for any movement to come after you to prove you lied. So yeah, you'll end up paying anyway. Unless you just flee the country and never come back.

But is it really worth it? Why the fuck would you be in a relationship with someone where you actually consider leaving the country with your money as a viable relationship exit strategy?

Also remember that hiding assets can be grounds for divorce. People are worried about what will happen if their spouse is an asshole and tries to take their money, but by hiding assets you're making the first asshole move.

You can buy fractions of a bitcoin, you know.  Your risk taking on bitcoin now (in the hopes of getting massive returns) is, if anything, diminished from the risk that the (now rich) early adopters took.  Your rewards could still be massive.

If there is any market which least deserves the over-blown fear that the rich get richer, and everyone else gets hosed. . . it's bitcoin.

Never invest more than you can afford to lose.  Past performance does not indicate future results.

Those disclaimers said: I have yet to hear of a single person holding their bitcoin for at least a couple years (which is not much time at all) who lost value (for the vast majority of bitcoin's history, you only needed to hold at least 7 months to make a sizeable return).  It is so laughably easy for anyone (rich or poor) to grow their wealth with bitcoin, that it borders on insanity how skeptical or even hateful so many people are towards the idea of even just buying a modest amount and setting it aside.

dpwpt1g,7dcbfa,"This is some low-level stuff that Vitalik does not understand well.

The Lightning Network is based on so-called Poon-Dryja payment channels.  Poon-Dryja channels have no lifetime and have no maximum number of payments before being forced to close, and are also bidirectional.  Poon-Dryja channels use transaction invalidation to ensure correct operation of the channel; in simpler terms, it's possible to attempt to cheat by playing old state on the blockchain, but old state will have a judgment window, during which the other party can provide a proof-of-fraud and claim the entire channel contents as damages in a ""justice"" transaction.

For example, suppose we have a channel that starts out with state (almkglor=1.0BTC, changes727=1.0BTC).  I pay you 0.5 BTC in exchange for service or product, so the new state is (almkglor=0.5BTC, changes727=1.5BTC).  However I then turn around and replay the old (almkglor=1.0BTC, changes727=1.0BTC) state on the blockchain.  You have a few days to show everyone that the old state was obsolete by presenting a proof-of-fraud in a justice transaction.  When you do, the entire 2.0BTC of the channel is awarded to you instead as damages, so I not only fail to steal the 0.5BTC I paid you, but I also lose the 0.5BTC that would have been rightfully mine as damages paid to you.

However, presenting the fraud proof to the blockchain is basically posting a transaction to the blockchain; even the ""replay old state"" is, in the end, posting a transaction to the blockchain.

What Vitalik is proposing is this:

1.  An attacker lays out an attack by setting up one or more Lightning nodes, and waiting until the nodes have 10 million channels connected directly to other nodes.
2.  The attacker waits until there is old state that is in the attacker's favor on all channels, and the current state is not in the attacker's favor.
3.  The attacker posts the old state of all the channels on the blockchain at once.
4.  Now there is a rush to post justice transactions on the blockchain, which won't fit because Bitcoin has a blocksize limit.  Oops!  We should have done sharding!!!  OH NOSE!

What Vitalik fails at here are below:

1.  The attacker can't post old state of all the channels quickly, either, because of the very same blocksize limit.  If it takes N days to process 10m justice transactions, it will take more than N days to process the old state transactions (the old state transactions are slightly larger than the justice transactions).  So if processing 10 million justice transactions will be a problem, the first problem will be for the attacker, which would need to post ***all*** the  10 million old-state transactions ***first***.
2.  Old-state transactions need to be signed out on by both counterparties, and have to allocate some fixed fee.  However a justice transaction only requires the signature of the one who is being cheated, and given a fraud proof, the cheated party can generate multiple versions of the justice transaction.  The upshot is that while the attacker is trying to push the 10 million old-state transactions, they have some fee rate that was fixed beforehand, and the attacker can't RBF it to a higher fee rate (would require a signature from the cheated parties, which of course the cheated parties won't provide) and can't CPFP it faster (for technical reasons the attacker's outputs are timelocked so they can't CPFP the old-state transactions).  However, justice transactions can be rewritten (RBF'ed) to have higher fee in case of blockchain spam; only the cheated party needs to sign it.  For example if the current state is (almkglor=0.5BTC, changes727=1.5BTC) but I pushed the old (almkglor=1.0BTC, changes727=1.0BTC) state, you'd be willing to pay up to 0.5BTC in fees for the justice transaction (with the remaining 1.5BTC being rightfully yours) to push the justice transaction on the blockchain.  On the blockchain, justice can outbid injustice.  More justice transactions on the blockchain, fewer attacking old-state transactions, slowing down the attack and costing the attacker precious, precious money.

Thus, the blocksize limit actually hits the attacker in this situation harder than the defender, and is the correct solution to the problem.",1510842867.0,242,almkglor
dpwpj14,7dcbfa,"When there is a dispute in a Lightning Channel, they have to be settled on the blockchain. This happens by broadcasting the most recent state of the channel to the network and having it confirmed in a block.

A malicious participant can however broadcast an older state to the blockchain that gives him more money than he deserves. The Lightning Network is designed as such that when an attacker does this, the honest counterparty can broadcast another transaction that proofs that the first one was malicious and that punishes the attacker and gives all the money to the honest party.

Now, this proof needs to be provided within a certain time aka number of blocks. If it's not provided within X blocks, the malicious party gets his way.

So the attack Vitalik describes is that when an attacker closes a fuckton of channels maliciously at the same time, all the honest parties must send their fraud proofs in the next X blocks. If the number of channels closed maliciously is bigger than the space in the next X blocks for fraud proof transactions, now all honest parties can have their fraud proof tx confirmed in time.

Note that first, such an attack costs a very big amount of prep cost in tx fees. Second, for every fraud proof that *does* get confirmed, the attacked loses all his money in the channel, so he will probably only try to do this with channels on which his balance is 0 (this can be a flag for you to close the channel beforehand or rebalance it). And third, you (or your Lightning Wallet) decides on a number of X that you are comfortable with.

The number X, the number of blocks within which a fraud proof must be published, is a trade-off between the time it takes to fully settle a channel and the chance of falling victim of such an attack. Since Lightning channels should not have to be closes all thst often, a very big value for X is reasonable. If X is ~a day or up to a week worth of blocks, you should be safe.

I'd rather the justice terms be more aligned with x% out my remaining balance in the last contract state with a minimum fee of y.  

To further elaborate, in your example, if the justice state is (almkglor=0.5BTC, changes727=1.5BTC), almkglor wouldn't lose all .5 remaining BTC.  But, in my ideal situation, the justice terms would make almkglor lose perhaps 5% of the 5 btc. This 5% works out to .025 BTC total loss, but if the minimum justice fee were .03, we'd round up to a .03 penalty since that balance is still available.  

Also, is there any way to instantly open a new channel when closing a prior one to avoid on-chain fee expenses?  And, is there any chance these contracts for payment can be swapped by institutional members?  The latter seems very unlikely due to private key concerns.

This is impossible as of BOLT 1.0.  Nodes are supposed to negotiate a non-zero `channel_reserve` parameter for the channels they participate in; this is the minimum amount that each of us must have in the channel.  For example if the channel reserve is 0.1BTC and the total channel backing fund is 1.0BTC, then a channel state can range from (almkglor=0.1BTC, sroose=0.9BTC) to (almkglor=0.9BTC, sroose=0.1BTC), but no further.

The `channel_reserve` parameter was added precisely to prevent this attack from being costless, and to encourage you to retain ""depleted"" channels and keep network connectivity high.

>an attacker closes a fuckton of channels maliciously at the same time

The blocksize limit that slows down justice transactions also slows down the closing of a fuckton of channels, too.  See also: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7dcbfa/can_anyone_expound_on_vitaliks_reply_i_assume_hes/dpwpt1g/",1510843661.0,23,almkglor

Justice transactions are something your software will automatically send if it sees a transaction in the blockchain attempting to defraud the channel. Even better, justice transactions can be crafted ahead of time and given to a 3rd party (outsourced).

If Alice and Bob know each other and are nice, Bob can give Alice back the 4 coins that were supposed to be hers at the most recent channel state.  But he doesn't have to; he can keep them, as he can't be sure that Alice wasn't trying to catch him off guard.",1510870098.0,3,Dryja

dpx9hwr,7dcbfa,"The DAO was based on issues within the ethereum code, while the parity bug was related to L2-esque programming by Parity.

With DAO, the code itself enabled the theft, and ""code is law"" caused the ideological eth/etc split. In the case of parity, the flaw resulted in the codelaw being (essentially) deleted

DAO was explicit theft where a fork was used to stop the thief benefitting and return the funds. Parity simply lost the coins by making them stuck in a nonexistent contract.

There's no immediate need to rush for a solution here since the coins can't be moved by anyone right now. Including a fix in the next major update of ethereum can be done easily and without contention.

That said, people need to know what they are getting into when they put currency into untested contracts by a development group (parity) that's got a history of bad code review. A few more fuck ups like this and maybe ethereum will stop bailing out bad user investments

I have both BTC and XRP (and some other coins) - one good thing I like with Ripple is that they've been upfront with their plan of getting banks first and slowly introducing them to XRP - a slow process yes - but a very targeted and planned one. 

Sure it may end up fizzling out later on but at least open your eyes and see the potential and not just outright dismiss it simply because it's not being pumped right now. Boring and stable - yes - but so far, they never wavered from the plan/strategy they've been saying all this time (slow and steady).

At the very least if it's only the price rise you want - see Stellar/IBM - one simple partnership and Stellar shot up. Same thing can happen with Ripple and the way they seem aggressive with going after banks - my personal opinion is that the possibility is quite high that they will get a big financial institution later on.

EDIT: To further my point, the ripple conference last month was lacking a lot in term of mentioning XRP and the like (much to the divided anger of the XRP community) and one of the main people later said that it was on purpose as they don't want to seem as though they are trying to peddle the engine when people are already apprehensive about buying the car. 

Also to the point of not needing XRP. A report was done by the conglomerate of banks (SBI) who are on board with ripple and they showed a 23% increase in renenue using XRP as liquidity over non-xrp method and essentially concluded saying I don't know why you wouldn't use XRP. In my opinion, probably down to fear of the new and not wanting to be the first one to make a potential mistake.

to help, firstly it's 10 min block times.  

Litecoin has 2.5min blocktimes.  Do you see people using bitcoin or litecoin?  This highlights the blocktime is not that big of an issue.


Next LN only requires confirmations on and off the network, once you're on transactions are instant.  (Actually all bitcoin transactions are near instant, it's just the confirmation time gives certainty that the funds are double spent which is why most people wait for 1 or 2 confirmations before completing a trade).

Finally blocktimes are to give the network time to propogate correctly. If you have 15 seconds it's very easy to have long running contested forks so people will wait for say 50 confirmations before knowing the funds are successfully transferred... this is basically what we have now.


It's good you're highlighting a usecase issue you would like to see solved, just saying shorter block times isn't the solution you're after.

Do you not understand the redistribution of wealth here? By increasing the blocksize you are reducing fee's yes...at the cost of lost security to the network and a redistribution of that same cost on to the backs of node operators. 

Bitcoin isn't free. The costs are always there, its just a matter of who pays them. I would rather see a system that forces the users to pay at the point of terminal than a system that hides the costs on the back end that results in the system failing.

This like email. Maybe you use gmail because its free, but I specifically don't use gmail because its free. The cost of it is being absorbed by the selling of your personal information to 3rd parties. Its no different in bitcoin, if you remove the cost from one end of the spectrum the cost doesn't disappear, it just ends up rearing its head on another less optimal-spectrum of the network.

Node operators are a major backbone of bitcoin. Without them, its worthless. Who's going to spend their bitcoin if its worthless? You might be tempted to argue that bitcoin users are equally important, and to that you would be right. But as history has shown, bitcoin users do not stop using bitcoin when fee's get high.

The scenario you describe is non-existant. Its pointless to wax philosophical about unrealistic scenarios which will never come to pass.

The fee market is exactly that .... a market. This means there will always be competitive bidding for a valuable resource. Thats the entire point of not having a unbounded blocksize.

The argument from big blockers is that we are artificially restricting blockspace. But the obvious counter argument to that is that without the restriction a true free market to determine the price of blockspace cannot occur.

Ironically, this argument from big blockers always comes from free market idealists. They argue against their own philosophy. But like most people I come across from these ideological directions, they all want/need perfect utopia scenarios in order for their theories to work in society.

Is your assumption that the reward is mostly gone? If you push through the numbers you'll realize this is a very, very *very* long way aways.

Bitcoin ran just fine at $600 with a 12.5 btc reward. Nothing but steady increases in hashpower. What do you think the price of btc will be in 2020? 15k? 25k? Lets just assume that its 10k. 10k @ 6.25 btc is $60,250.00 per block. It was @ $7500 per block in july of 2016 after the halving, and we all know what happened to hashrate then.

It skyrocketted.

Lets assume, at an extremely conservative value, that btc is 20k by 2024. Thats $62,500.00 usd @ 3.25 btc.

And I expect this to continue on at this rate for however long bitcoin exists. Yes, bitcoin *can* keep going up and will, because its a limited supply resource who's purpose is being massively integrated into society.

Gold will have only ever been used for speculation and as a hedge against inflation. People cant *use* gold (except for its edge case uses in electronics, jewelry, etc). 

But for however many purposes there is for gold, there will be a thousandfold utilitarian purposes for btc.

This will make its scarce resource properties continue to accelerate its value over time.

Eventually, a 0.39 btc reward (2036) will be worth more than the 12.5 btc reward today. Yes, I think its more than reasonable to see a 100k btc in 20 years. No, im not crazy. Thats literally 4 doublings.

We will have 4 doublings when we hit 11.2k from july 2016. We are already at 3x! 3 doublings in 1 year. Think of how crazy that is. Think of the potential btc has when you put that into perspective. If we can double 3 on a good year, then its not irrational to think we could have a few doublings every 4 years. At 2 doublings, mining rewards double in profitability ever 4 years.

People dont realize how quickly btc will accelerate in value. Its not about how much it gains, its about its doublings. 100 to 200 in value is just as big as a jump as 25k to 50k!

>Whereas when the pool is empty it does not matter how low the difficulty gets, there is no incentive for anyone to mine.

dpxdqm0,7dc3ft,"From your comment I'm not too terribly sure you understand how bitcoin works...

Your wallet software creates a transaction just like filling out a check. That transaction is then submitted to a node (for free) which then validates it, and forwards it to other nodes which validate (for free) and forward, until it works its way to a miner's node and the miner node who validates it once again and decides to include it in a block. This block then goes out to each and every node, and each node runs back through each and every transaction (for free) and checks to make sure they are all valid before updating their network view. 

This works well when there's no real volume. A handful of transactions is easy and the reason to run a node may be worth it. But if you have many many transactions being transmitted, the node must validate each one (for free), and then revalidate each one in the block (for free). If we let this go on forever, eventually the cost gets too big for you to run a node. You couldn't run one if you wanted too. It gets so costly that the companies who can afford it, start charging for access, just like vpns and newsbin sites, or they just sell your activity like Facebook and Google. You also are at their beckon will if they want to give you access. US govt wants to shut you down. They simply tell node operators to block you (so longer uncensorable).

Not only this, transactions still have a fee, because you can't have no fee and limited supply. Someone needs to pay the miners. BCH isn't sustainable in its short term, no one who knows what they are talking about thinks it will be 0 fee forever. And how can you force someone to pay a fee, if supply isn't limited? If I'm getting in whether I pay $5, $.01 or $0, why would I pay anything? That's called tragedy of the commons. 

So, I'm not really sure what you are talking about ""contracting"" through a node, but that doesn't happen through btc or BCH. But I can assure you, increasing on chain transactions only will most definitely lead to contracting/permission access to the bitcoin network through very expensive nodes that can handle blocks. And it would still take 10 minutes for payments to be verified. And there would still be a fee. And everyone can track your money. This is just life with a distributed ledger system. 

That's why we are scaling off chain, making it permissionless, P2P, and uncensored on chain, that anyone can run a node and settle transactions with, without needing anything special.

-> transaction on LN are less resource intensive to verify/process, therefore much lower fees will be charged. Are LN transactions expected to have a comparable level of security relative to the those on underlying chain- ie is there a cost vs risk trade-off?
-> how will/can BTC counteract miner consolidation--a natural tendency seen in all businesses and industries
->  what is the downside (trade-off) of lowering the Miner difficulty level? Obviously transaction volume would be UP and cost DOWN. Is it the probability of creating (temporary) split chains (ie forks), until timing related differences among the verification by nodes have been resolved?",1510875916.0,1,VVWW88

These are simple contracts that can be traded at a speed of 1000's per second because they are off chain.  

Now, what if JQ wants to settle on chain, and decides to broadcast the first transaction as it has more favorable terms where JQ gets alloted 1 BTC?  Well, Lightning contracts have justice terms, and broadcasting that transaction still locks your funds up for n cycles (just like miners can't move their coins on BCH for n cycles).  During that time, CX can spot the crime and execute the revised contract with justice terms.  In that scenario, the justice terms see the crime transaction, and CX ends up with all BTC in the channel (1 BTC).

I don't think that's accurate. When opening a channel with a second party, there's no ""originator"" and ""didn't start it themselves"" from the point of view of the main blockchain. From its perspective, somehow (off-chain), the two parties  got together, threw some money into a shared address and broadcast that new address to the blockchain. There's no ""receiving end"" nor ""sending end"" in a Lightning Network channel; the funds can flow both ways if need be (e.g. you open a channel to a coffee shop, where you put in $40 and they put in $10. You buy a coffee for $3, so the chain state updates from $40/$10 to $37/$13. But then you win a raffle for being the 100th customer that day, and they give you a $10 credit at the store. So the funds shift to $47/$3) and all the participants need to track and care about is what the current state is.

The current state is confirmed by transactions held by the two parties that they could broadcast at any time. Each transaction they hold gives them access to their portion of the funds instantly, and the other side's funds after some amount of time (so in that example, I hold a transaction where I'd get $47 as soon as the transaction gets confirmed, and the coffee shop has one that says they get $3 as soon as it's confirmed). Now, if the coffee shop is only planning to acknowledge one of the two chains after a split, but I'm willing to accept both/either, as soon as the chain splits, I could transmit my ""give me $47"" transaction (without replay protection) to get however many coins that is on both chains. The coffee shop would notice that on the main chain and broadcast their own ""give me $3"" transaction to prevent me from claiming their portion too in a few days. If there was no replay protection on that transaction, then it would apply to both chains, and I'd not get their share of the other chain's assets (only my $47 worth).

So even though they didn't upgrade, they didn't ""lose"" anything, and I didn't gain anything I wasn't entitled to have (if I had closed out the channel before the split, I would have still gotten $47 worth of coins in the split; they'd just be outside the channel then).

During ~2009, I even saw where some institutions issuing certificates of deposits were doing so fraudulently and thus stealing customer funds.  No system, even BCH, is completely without risk.  

So, what are the real risks of the Lightning network?  The best way to determine this would be by measuring historical data, which we don't have. So, we're left to identifying possible failures and their chance of occurring.  I see the possible failures follows:

Failure to monitor a channel (negligence to monitor should not count.  only technical problems with monitoring)  
Unintentional contract broadcasting by the paying party  (receiver does not have these contracts.  A well written wallet should delete old contracts)  
On-chain settlement failures  

With bounties, failure to monitor a channel seem like it should happen < 99.95% of the time.  It may be possible to attack a channel, but until an attack vector is established, nobody can prediction how this would affect the system.  If/when a vector is determined, I'm happy to discuss it.    

With unintentional contract broadcasting, it seems a hacked wallet or code tampering would be the only way to make this happen.  And if the wallet can be hacked, you are left with the same risk as losing your private keys.  So, this risk too is negligible.  

The last problem would be with on-chain settlement.  This seems like a legitimate concern, but well written contracts with high justice fees would mostly offset these problems.   I can see from blockchain that we have 65k unprocessed transactions on BTC.  What I can't see is a list of these transactions with their time-stamps sorted by fee.   If I could, we could get an idea of the risk of having a contract go unprocessed.  I expect, however, that only lower fee transactions have sat in the mem-pool for any significant period of time.  Certainly much lower than the ~7 days a lightning contract would lock funds for.  And if 7 days isn't enough, we could always write contracts with 1 month expirations.

If Alice is intending this link to be a super long-running link to Bob not for a specific purpose, but to provide additional links in the overall network, it would be a good idea for Bob to contribute at least some to the link, so the payments could go both ways (If one of Bob's connections wants to send to one of Alice's connections, it can't happen if Bob has no assets in the link).

*""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe

(section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.*  ***Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.***  *A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.*

*""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  

That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.*

*""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""*

Pathological lying (also called pseudologia fantastica and mythomania) is a behavior of habitual or compulsive lying.  It was first described in the medical literature in 1891 by Anton Delbrueck. Although it is a controversial topic, pathological lying has been defined as ""falsification entirely disproportionate to any discernible end in view, may be extensive and very complicated, and may manifest over a period of years or even a lifetime"". Individuals may be aware they are lying, or may believe they are telling the truth.

Oh heck no, I don't think it will decrease consumerism. While some Millennials are getting better with managing their money, most people, of all generations, are not. Lots of Americans, and those in Western society, are all about ""feel good now and fck the future"" spending.

Hopefully you can see this [Fred graph](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=259705&rn=4969) of consumer debt as percent of income. And it's rising again, like in past bubbles. Some people have learned to decrease their debt since the peak of 2001. But I wouldn't say the majority of people care much to reduce their debt. Tabular [data is here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/housedebt/default.htm) since 1980.

This ""consumer debt"" appears to include [mortgages and credit cards](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/housedebt/about.htm). Unfortunately there is data only to April 2017, so FRED is quite behind for some reason.

I wonder if a factory owner holding cryptocurrency might think twice about buying a bunch of raw materials to produce disposable goods when holding onto the coins might actually make more profit. If there's also profit in not making something maybe we'd only make the things that we can also take a sense of pride from.

Maybe this kind of economy will fuck things up for the average worker though. If a lot less things will be produced, a lot less jobs will be needed. That combined with automation and AI taking over so many jobs probably makes a radical re-organization of our society very necessary.

But due to things like planned obsolescence which companies like Apple are famous for exploiting people have lost or never knew the values of buying and cherishing premium goods. I have a pair of work boots that are on their third pair of soles. I am a woodworker and use tools that are over a hundred  years old because they were quality to begin with.

>Bitcoin Cash upgraded by removing a temporary fix put in years ago that is no longer needed. Without full blocks there is no fee market, everyone can use bitcoin just fine and they don't have to worry about if they paid enough to get their transaction confirmed. Bitcoin cash confirmed all transactions in the next block for a minimal fee of usually under a cent. The upgraded version of bitcoin, bitcoin cash, also removed RBF, this means it is no longer practical for people to double spend a transaction and thus people selling items for bitcoin can trust a transaction as soon as it is broadcast (0-configuration txs are safe again, before i could buy something, go outside, reboradtcast those funds going somewhere else with a higher fee and since not everyone can get into a block the miners will take my higher fee tx before the lower fee one and I can get most my money back and steal from sellers, bitcoin cash fixed this problems.

I'm not sure how the logistics would work for converting thousands (millions?) of wallets at once. It would probably make much more sense to only convert new wallets.

There is also the issue of compatibility. Older wallet implementations might balk at newer segwit addresses. Some users wouldn't understand when their software or another service refused to send to a new segwit address. That would lead to an influx of support requests on both ends.

Sure I could well be, but no-one gets any further when they are dismissed. Both sides of the community sould be more bipartisan, it is only hurting both. I am most definitely trying to ""sow discourse"", without it the only thing left on both sides is propaganda and memes. 

At this point I am left thinking both sides have working scaling solution, are run by people who main drive is profit and control and 90% of the users on both sides sit in their own little echo chambers

IMO if nodes become too expensive for hobbyists to run, that is not a good thing, you can discuss that with me or not, but I'm not likely to change my point of view without discussion.

Blocks on BTC are running at ~1MB, but lets start with 32MB blocks, the max I think BCH supprts without hard fork atm(?), following mores law, doubling every 18mo, it will still take ~12 years to get to the minimum block size for 1tx per person above. Sure 2nd layer stuff is untested, and doesn't run at the moment, but if it does, it will be able to do 100tx per person and well surpass 11GB blocks capabilities in just 3 years based on Moore's Law

As I said in my other post, to reach the 7 billion tx level, with pure block size increase and following Moore's Law (so to estimate costs not getting too much larger for running a node) it would take 12 years, the Lightning Network would get to the same throughput (and much more) in 3 years. 

This is why I changed the first post, to remove that block increase *can't* scale to the needed size while keeping nodes affordable, it definitely can if you allow enough time for hardware improvement to keep the costs down, but it seems other solutions will do it better, faster, and cheaper.

Demand is based on many fuzzy things, but the basics are usefulness/utility. Even 'SoV' people are claiming that its utility is in 'storing value' whatever that means. When the price moves wildly, I would think the last use case you'd be touting was the store of value one, but that's me.

But the point is, if these people didn't think Bitcoin reliably worked as a SoV, then that percentage of demand would eventually disappear. So it looks like this prediction is based on continuing growth in demand for bitcoin given that supply is already known. The problem with this is that demand is based on successfully executing your use cases. So bitcoin is having trouble as a payment network. Constraining it to 1MB will ensure that that is the case for the near future. Which means that Demand will be constrained by the throughput of a single block and only those who view bitcoin as a store of value will continue to show demand, so how can the price rice much more than it is now? Even with speculation, if the demand doesn't materialize (due to people finding out the fees are too high, or wait times too long, or not usable at PoS, etc.) then the price will crater if supply stays the same (which it will).",1510839968.0,1,thethrowaccount21

This sounds noble, but considering the high fees and trans backlog, is the equivalent of pontificating about better building foundations and improved concrete pour techniques (10% more concrete throughput) while you're house in on fire. Your priorities should reflect the urgency of the situation.

Anyone who had the best interest of the network in mind, REGARDLESS of how they feel about L2 and L3 solutions, would advocate raising the block size, even if to 2 MB to buy time for the testing and implementation of those features.

The block chain to me seems like a wonderful key for one door and one door only and a mediocre key for a database or any other ledger. ,1510847083.0,2,BoyWhoCriedBourgeois

Priority Transactions were claimed to be a minor feature that was subject to the whim of the miners, but it has a very important function. It ensures Bitcoin remains fungible, that is that every coin has the same value, which is a critical feature of anything to be used as money.


For example, 1 Bitcoin spread over 100 inputs is worth considerably less that 1 Bitcoin contained in single input thanks to all transaction fees need to collect the fractional coin back together.

* bitcoin/cryptocurrencies will never go away. By their nature, even if there's a UN resolution banning the exchange of crypto for fiat, it will go underground, barter, etc. If such a thing happened, price would probably be depressed for a long time, but it's not going away, just like the internet's not going away.

* I want to promote this view a bit more, to get it out there and see what people in the community think about it, but here it is: I think bitcoin/cryptos have a really interesting use case for microtransactions. Say you want to charge $0.000001 for something like a newspaper article, or a song. Right now you kinda can't, not with Visa/Paypal/etc. But this is easy to do with cryptocurrencies that have low fees (yes, that's a swipe at BTC). If crypto's can scale, and if/when someone finds a cool high-volume use case for microtransactions, then we will see real demand to cryptos and the price will start making sense.


As relates to BTC vs. BCH.... I've already swiped BTC. The high fees are ridiculous... Lightning Network is cool, but after reading many posts on reddit/medium/twitter from various core devs, I am concerned that they've adopted an extremist view when it comes to decentralization and are not focused on scaling in a practical way. For BCH, fees are low, developers (i.e. deadalnix) seem reasonable, but not a lot of activity going on in terms of scaling beyond blocksize increase, so there's risk with BCH that not enough manpower/resources/innovation will materialize to scale it before some top 30 coin gets everyone's attention and usurps both BTC/BCH.


Conclusion: BTC/BCH have brand recognition that other coins do not, which is not to be underestimated, but do have non-trivial issues without clear solutions. Other coins are interesting. So invest a good bit into BTC/BCH and throw a little bit at the alt-coins to hedge your bets. Re-evaluate as necessary.

Give it time... the coin is 3 months old and consolidating $700-$1200.

It has:

- Relatively small but very involved community

- Supported by some of the biggest BTC miners

- Decentralized development

- Well known BTC devs (from before core) openly supporting BCH

- Some high profile early BTC adopters openly supporting BCH

- Possible support from ""segwit2x"" companies in the near future.

BCH is gaining ground in areas BTC lost long ago:

- gambling

- remittances

- commerce

- Hell, even gimmicks like u/tippr are back

Most importantly:

No scaling issues on the short - mid term, BCH can scale up to 32MB blocks.

BTC scaling depends 100% on off-chain lighting networks and side-chains, both are still vaporware and at least ~18 months away.
The other core ""product"" Segwit has stalled at ~10% adoption, and even with full 100% adoption it will never reach more than ~2mb scaling.

Easy, everybody is buying it for the sole purpose of selling it to the greater fool. At least that is what I'm doing, I hope BTC will go to 30k so I can dump my profits on the newbs. I leave my bitcoins on the exchange, I don't even bother using the network anymore. That's NOT a healthy sign!

dpx9cur,7dbm3n,"What Bitcoin has become, is not what it was meant to be. If you want to hold and don't care about blowing $50 on a single transaction, that's for you.

Bitcoin was created to build a decentralized and free (independent) trustless economy. We all knew its value would go up over time but, I don't think ""stock"" exchanges were ever in Satoshi's eyes. It was meant to buy, sell and trade for goods, services as an alternative to international fiat... Of course, the miners and early adopters needed to find a way to utilize their coin and it couldn't function without a connection to fiat, which loses value every day, hence a way to create wealth outside of the centralized financial economy...

People got greedy. That's why we have hodlers and not spedners. The early adopters build their wealth with the exchange of goods services and currency conversions. Early adopters sold their BTC for big ticket items... 

If it isn't going to be used for it's actual purpose, and only becomes a store of value for money to make more money, if it can't/won't be used to buy goods and services, it ends up being as worthless as fiat.

So mining became less profitable, while bitcoin gained higher demand and we need the miners to confirm the transactions. Of course, the cost of transactions had to go up. It went up in proportion to the value of the coin and the difficulty of solving blocks... Miners should be receiving a reward for mining that is profitable. Users are complaining about the cost while ignoring the basis of bitcoin's creation. More miners should be mining. More service and retail providers should be accepting Bitcoin.  

Bitcoin gained more hodling value than use cases and, still has not managed to go mainstream. Something had to change.  Who says the cost of Bitcoin Cash transactions will never go up? 

Ultimately, the way Bitcoin has gone, without a drastic increase in value and rewards, none of this has been fair to the miners.",1510862233.0,2,HooRYoo

Theres no functional value to the coin and its only good as a speculative asset to make money from.

Any new money they have to invest is going into BTC. I personally don't know anyone reinvesting into BCH. Just my experience. Sorry to say but there is a danger to centralizing the currency either way this goes. So, I don't think most people see that argument as all that important. Price and adoption are more important.

There is a plan and there is muscle behind it. The only question is timing. If BCH hits $3k and BTC $5k nobody will say what will happen next.

dpwy9kx,7dbm3n,"I never understood the path to victory for BCH.  Bitcoin is doing well because a lot of investors, who don't understand or appreciate the tech, want to buy some.  When they buy it, they are all buying BTC.  So the only way to win is for exchanges to call BCH ""bitcoin"" and not even sell BTC.  Xapo and Bitfinex (60ish% of the exchange market) are doing the exact opposite.  BCH is simply not *different* enough to merit them switching to it.  It can't just be a little bit better, it has to be a lot better to merit exchanges abandoning ""legacy"" bitcoin... or a lot more profitable.  I don't think the tech or the transaction times or centralization or anything other than *adoption* is the motivating factor for these markets.  You can call this a bubble or just deflation, but it isn't nearly as intelligent as most here are claiming.  Investors also assumed the housing market was intelligent.  Getting rich is 99% of the motivation for new investors.

dpxlbv3,7dbm3n,"Exactly. 

OP is forgetting a key aspect. Bitcoin can not grow any more with the blocks limited to where they're at. It's at the ceiling already. When people send crypto to an exchange like bittrex, it costs them $20 and can take days. People will seek alternative trading pairs to buy with. Bitcoin can't grow much more than it currently is before something else will start to be used as the main trading pair at exchanges. And whatever that coin is, will overtake Bitcoin.

Also, Bitcoin Cash was $300 a few weeks ago. All that's happened is we had a FOMO after 2x was cancelled, then when the exchanges started crashing, it stopped it. But you've got to have patience, look at the bigger picture of what's happening here. Bitcoin will be unable to grow to $20,000 a coin because no one will spend $50 to buy $100 of coin, and even if they did, the coin being used to send to exchanges for the trading pairs would most certainly not be bitcoin.

After a 8MB block one needs a 100MB block, then 1GB blocks etc. It might be possible to scale the network to the size of VISA or paypal. But that's not what people with a vision have in mind. We want microtransactions and single Satoshi transactions. We want THE internet of money, the primary network for value. And that means that value is streamed, not like today sent in blocks of cash or in monthly bill payments. It means realtime money transfer. That network needs to be able to process around 10^6 the number of transactions VISA handles daily. No block size increase will fix that. We will need higher layers on top of a secure value store for that matter.

If you want/need to spend money in crypto today use Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Litecoin etc. But that's obvious and doesn't even need to be said, because no one will pay super high fees for a coffee.

My understanding is their dominance is derived by a two-sided network effect: users go where the apps are and developers go where the users are.

It is evident BCH (USD, EUR, etc.) is driven by one-sided network effects: more users make the network more powerful (e.g. a telephone is not useful if you are the only one with a telephone).

**My question: does BCH have any two-sided network effects?** My suspicion is yes, or it will in the future, but I can not put my finger on it. I would like to hear the community's thoughts on this.

For example, Ethereum has the potential to be driven by a two-sided network effect: developing smart contracts that users want (although I do not see a ""killer app"" today).

LN is a sidechain (lacks security) where you ""transfer"" (in reality lend/lock) bitcoins from a user to another while not putting those transactions on the chain. It's an escamotage, it's no longer p2p, it's less secure and has a shitton of technical problems and it probably doesn't work. You also need to create multiple channels and thus divide your money. 

This is a nice article, read also the comments and the following up article where he tackles most criticism of his article (and the comments to the article too, read both sides).

https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800

Not only that, shutting down or regulating bitcoin is extremely hard as you have no way to control the single actors.

This is totally different (and breaks U.S. law probably) with LN because each actor is no longer a **user** but an **exchanger**:

https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf

 *The administrator of that repository will be a money transmitter to the extent that it allows transfers of value between persons or from one location to another. This conclusion applies, whether the value is denominated in a real currency or a convertible virtual currency.*

Lignthing Network is purely unworkable, probably illegal and will fuck up Bitcoin, no matter the propaganda spread from /r/bitcoin and you must as dumb as a shoe to believe in that. And you don't fuck up with U.S. tax agencies, ever. It's bullshit promoted to calm people while fees are rising and transactions are slow. 

""Oh but we will have LN, lolol, solve scalability"".

Blockchains are databases, at some point you need to increase the number of rows in your database.

Each other solution **is not p2p**, it's risky from much too may reasons, it's slavery to somebody's interest to take fees for routing transactions that are **very** centralized and needs tons of liquidity.

I think you are off on this point, not all people rushed into buying as soon as they could. Bitcoin network congestion is still causing issues for people wanting to unload their BTC.

The same exchanges that are limiting people's ability to sell off their BCH are the same exchanges limiting others from buying it. I've halted my weekly buy orders of BTC, while waiting for the exchange to start offering BCH.

dpwnarq,7dbm3n,"> But many people that wanted to sell BCH haven't been able to do so.

I'm not sure how true this is really.  I would think by now most users who wanted to dump BCH for BTC have already done so. Some are pointing to Coinbase for example releasing BCH in January.  But let's think about it:  How many people  kept most of their funds in Coinbase on Aug 1...?  Coinbase at that time had not said they would support BCH at all, and in fact they warned users to withdraw funds prior to the fork if they wanted the forked coin because at that time they were not even promising to convert and release the forked coin to account holders.  Obviouisly Coinbase has a lot of users and accounts, but I assume that most people transferred a majority of their holdings prior to Aug 1 to their hardware wallets or other cold storage, or to exchanges promising to convert post-fork.

On a side note, I have a feeling that a lot of the rhetoric from both sides in terms of unloading all of their BTC for BCH, or all of their BCH for BTC, has been overblown, representing emotional positions on one side or the other.  In reality, one would have to be truly foolish to dump all of one for the other.  It just doesn't make sense to ever put all of your eggs in one basket.  I continue to hold all of both, but even if I were an ideologue on one side or the other, I might hedge by converting some percentage of my BCH to BTC or vice versa, but I would not go all the way and convert 100%.

dpxhbnz,7dbm3n,"> When you see yourself opening an LN channel, do you think you'd rather do it on a network where it's nearly free to do so, or on a network where the fee is more than $100? 

BTC can and almost probably will increase the block size at a later stage, possibly after a layer 2 network is ready for the masses. Until then low fees are not a priority on the BTC side, as you have noticed and as became the main reason for the BCH fork for everyone who disagrees.

As soon as something like the lightning network is up and working, which chain will be more attractive? Blockchain A which kept itself relatively small by not clogging itself up with coffee and chewing gum transactions or Blockchain B which is a multitude in size. In addition, Blockchain A will probably offer a higher level of decentralisation because of its smaller nature.

I believe in BTC but I still see why BCH is needed in the shorter term. Because cryptocurrency can be used for transactions here and now and it's awesome. It really is much better than cash in many ways.

> If a super scalable payment system like the envisioned LN is going to happen, there is no guarantee it will only happen on Bitcoin.

That's true and another component why everything is still speculation at this point. There is also a great war going on between the two chains. Keep in mind that there are a lot of crypto millionaires and companies around, each with their own interest in this war.
Most miners probably don't like layer 2 solutions at all because [it takes away some of their work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toL1tXrLA1c).
Many core developers are now working for a company called Blockstream and I can understand the critique about that. Blockstream is all pro-lightning and therefore pushes for keeping the blockchain as a secure store of value without any focus on low transaction fees for layer 1.

Also there is a war here on reddit with paid shills on both sides as far as I can judge. There is also censorship in /r/bitcoin which I can't stand and is the reason why I left that channel. One thing that still stays with bitcoin is the fact that whenever a lot of money is in play then big games of power are played. It's one of the things about money that cryptocurrency can't fix. It's best to ignore all that bashing then eventually it will be silenced and we will just see BCH and BTC as two different coins that are here to stay. That's my bet for now, as I'm holding both.

Personally I don't want to be in a situation where it's unfeasible for a motivated average user to verify the full chain as Bitcoin would then, in my opinion, lose its trustlessness. Others disagree. Small blockers tend to favour layer 2 solutions like lightning networks.

The argument most people have in here is a variation of ""moore's law, as bitcoin grows, bandwith and harddisk space will get cheaper in tandem"" or ""no-one really needs to run a full node anyway except miners and large transaction processors/businesses, the rest can use SPV wallets (which only download the block headers and the details of relevant transactions)"". Big blockers tend to feel that in practise, lightning networks would not be all that peer-to-peer and would centralise on payment-processor hubs.

I fall on the small blocker side of things, but that's the best non-biased answer I can give. Those of us who are intellectually honest will admit this is by no means a completely settled debate on either side.

dpwkex1,7dblzm,"I have seen so many posts asking about this exact thing. The majority consensus is don't spend money you don't have.

Here is my alternate take on it : as someone who works in business companies take out loans to fund capital investments (PP&E typically). These investments are typically for something the company needs but can't rationally afford to pay all at once for. Cryptocurrencies do not fit the bill for an investment financed by a debt.

On the other hand, if the price increases by 50% and you sell your cash value from the loan is now $750 - initial loan - accrued interest, so you come out on top and can reinvest the profit (or keep the profit in crypto). 

Devil's advocate : if the price falls by 50% and you sell you are still on the hook for $250 plus interest on the initial loan. 

There isn't a way to accurately track how the market for cryptocurrencies will change, so it is an extremely high-risk investment that cannot see any returns until some of that investment is liquidated to pay back the loan.

I don't recommend doing this, but if you are going to anyway make sure you plan it out properly. For $500 plan it out as though you are going to buy $100 worth of cryptocurrencies every month for 6 months (always over-plan expenses, hence the $600 total), and make sure you can afford to spend that money.

What most people call ,""censorship"" is simple forum moderation. With contentious topics such as a split ledger, there will always be people unhappy with the state of one sub reddit and there will be a flow of people into another sub reddit.

People on r/btc were complaining about censorship stats that showed r/bitcoin removed 3,800 posts in October, thinking it was an ""insane amount of censorship"".

Over on r/leagueoflegends we removed 18,500 posts in October, or 600% more in the same timeframe.

This is simply how larger subreddits work. As more people flow in, more posts need to be removed, more comments removed, more people banned. 

I can't speak about how the r/bitcoin mods do their thing or what criteria they use, but "" censorship"" doesn't exist on a privately owned subreddit. The subreddit is owned entirely by the moderators who create and maintain it, and you have no god given right to post or participate in it.

> It's really interesting how we have such similar values while our outlook on bitcoin is so drastically different due to a difference in how we view the technology's limitations.

> A couple of points you made I'd like to add some counterpoint to:

> 1. You began by assuming that the lightning network would be implimented as the first 2nd layer scaling solution. I realize that the ZAP and Eclair wallets are further along than most projects out there, but the correct way to deploy the lightning network is now on the 3rd level, not the 2nd. Therefore, even if LN is successfully tested and released soon, the channels won't be developed soon as they're waiting on a far better network on the 3rd layer. So I don't think we'll see the LN before we see several different Sidechains, including Rootstock and Lumino and of course Blockstream's liquid. There could be 20 others next year too, any of them could take off and become a primary way to transact with bitcoin.

> 2. You also made the assumption that within the LN, ""the 'little guy' is economically compelled to transact through a lightening hub 'liquidity provider', ie. a trusted party"" and that this third party would eventually ""be regulated as providers of financial services."" Thankfully I can report to you now that this won't be the case, because of the nature of the lightning network hubs... They can be setup and run by everyone, including through TOR. The most common use of them IMHO would be for wallet providers to run their own LN hubs and you as a user would only have to bother joining one channel at a time within your own wallet to them that connects you to the greater LN hub network. Wallets like Electrum and Samourai could be hub providers, allowing you to join the network as you first set up your wallet, and you'd never need to think about it again while making payments until something closes out that channel, probably years later. Electrum and Samourai dev teams would go rogue first (I think they actually are now, in fact) before registering as a regulated provider of financial services.

> Therefore, for these and other reasons I still believe that Bitcoin will be the coin that gives anarchists their best chance of acheiving the cypherpunk dream.

The ASICBoost bug/trick is a way to lower energy consumption per hash; and miners are supposed to be greedy. The only issue I see with it is that some people have patented it (different people in different jurisdictions).

There is no proof that ASICBoost is beign used in production; and the version that has been found to exist in hardware in Antminers rely on a specific transaction ordering to work and should be detectable on the blockchain.

Large blocks will **eventually** lead to **miner centralization**, but all current research is clear on that small increases have absolutely no relevant effect at all on centralization pressure; miners have already centralized into pools due to efficiencies that come from economies of scale.

Satoshi never intended Rasberry Pi's to be running in every home. He fully anticipated that it would become more specialized and people will need to put in more capital expenditure as the system grew to Visa scale and eventually global scale.

dpx8bug,7dbg5a,"**Poisson distribution**

In probability theory and statistics, the Poisson distribution (French pronunciation [pwaˈsɔ̃]; in English often rendered ), named after French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume.

For instance, an individual keeping track of the amount of mail they receive each day may notice that they receive an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any particular piece of mail does not affect the arrival times of future pieces of mail, i.e., if pieces of mail from a wide range of sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number of pieces of mail received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution.

1. He's been in contact with the majority of miners, who have a secret agreement to switch at the beginning of a difficulty adjustment in the Core Chain.
2. He's overconfident and has nothing behind it. He's just trying to pump the price.
3. He knows that a staggering amount of Bitcoins will be dumped on market, perhaps in conjunction with a miner change, that will be impossible for it to recover from.

I was never in the camp that believed he was Satoshi, but it did seem likely to me that he was part of a team of Satoshi, or connected to them in some way. So I think that it's possible that he is in control of a lot of Bitcoins. If he and Roger dump all their coins at the same time, will it be enough? I'm not sure.

But if those Satoshi coins end up moving, I'm out of both BTC and BCH. Too bloody risky for my tastes. Again, I don't think he is Satoshi, but in the unlikely event that he somehow is, and sells those coins to prop up BCH, then it just creates a huge problem for BCH as well. Now, if he sent the Satoshi coins to a burn address on the BCH chain, and to an exchange on the BTC chain, then I think that would be all you would need to successfully flip the currency. I highly doubt that there's a bigger whale out there that could absorb such high sells from him alone, not to mention the panic sells that would ensue from such a transfer.

It will be game over once we can trade other altcoins in base BCH, mining power shifts over, effective and powerful DAA, and BTC gets strangled with $100USD+ fees with a backlog of 1 million pending transactions that will not get cleared for WEEKS or months (if ever).

Here's the thing. That's exactly how you would play it if you already knew there was a chance you would be outted and yet wanted plausible deniability.


There is no doubt this man is a genius, knows his Bitcoin, cryptography, statistics, psychology and economics very well.

He has a fire and a passion and a coherent vision.

Can anyone do this? Sure they can. But why the hell would someone do that if they were the fake?

Would the fake not look stupid when the ""real"" Satoshi revealed himself (if he ever did?)

Perhaps Craig Wright is aware that Satoshi died? Or was a close friend of his?

If Craig Wright goes on to fully implement the vision of the Satoshi Bitcoin Whitepaper within 5 years. Achieves 1 million transactions per second and can do it at scale, and properly decentralized.

Then does it matter that he is or is not the Satoshi? He will have completed the vision.

To me, he is a con the moment he deviates from the Whitepaper and the moment we do not see progress in Bitcoin Cash towards manifesting that vision.

I'm waiting for the 50,000 tx/second like he promised in the video within 1 year.  If he does that -- then I'll awaiting the next 1 million/second.

If he and the Bitcoin Cash team fails --- then I know he is not ""Satoshi""

4. Continue to pay your debt in smaller payments now to your bank.

5. Do the minimums on student loans and car payments while putting as much as possible into retirement and Bitcoin.

By the time your Bitcoin investment is worth a lot, your student loan and car will be far less due to making regular payments and consolidating your consumer debt. You can either pay the remainder of them off or continue doing what you're doing with the confidence that you have a lot of money in savings and an investment. 

By this point you will *definitely* have paid off the personal loan as long as you made regular payments. Less bills throughout paying them, less bills over all once you've paid them, and more Bitcoin and retirement.

I think bitcoin or custom made block chain technology will become standard in banking institutions in no time.

That said, there is a ton of appeal to decentralized currency and I believe that the value of bitcoin specifically will continue to rise. 

Also, technologies like Lightning https://cdecker.github.io/lightning-integration/de3cbef6d61ec06e46743a4ddfe691b85aba86d0172ec2ac1be4445aed6b62da.html almost nearing completion I suspect Bitcoin will continue to remain on top.

Mind you, this is a valuable lesson for people to control their own coins - if this (and Mt Gox, for those that actually do their reading) didn't teach people, nothing will.

EDIT: What they should offer, although clearly won't, is the ability to do an off-chain sale right now. So you tell them in writing that you want to, and contractually agree to, sell your BCH for market price. Then they lock that price in at that date and the BCH is no longer yours. Then, when Coinbase eventually gives you access, they lock your BCH and make it so that if you don't send them your BCH in 7 days, they take it from you themselves.

dpws1ea,7dbd1p,"Obviously because Coinbase warned you,  Probably you won't have a case,  and the service Coinbase offers is somewhat different from a normal trading exchange,  they likely have more accounts to deal with,  and may not have had the needed systems and modifications in place to handle a fork at the time of the split.    To assign the new types of coins,   I imagine this is a significant challenge regarding the logistics of splitting out and identifying and assigning the forked coins also requiring modifications to their systems  that may include cold storage,   and working out how much  Bitcoin cash  they may have in their possession now relative to users' BTC holdings at the date of the fork   ----  It's not clear to me if you sent X BTC from Coinbase to an external wallet after the fork  if your recipient randomly got or didn't get both BTC and BCH or  just BTC,   because some transactions could have gotten played onto both chains.

dpwju9b,7dbd1p,"Thanks for replying. That's how i see it.

Someone else answered that CB can send out pre-fork coins when someone withdraws though. That somewhat made sense to me because I thought coins were uniquely identifiable as a string of code but i just checked (upon your reply) and read that they are not, that they are only stored as balances on addresses.

So, can CB send such pre-forked coins?

Sorry to continue to ask questions, I'll get around to reading all of this on my own sooner rather than later, books and stuff, but in the meantime it's hard to find answers to such specific questions.",1510833488.0,1,davehzz
dpwhumh,7dbd1p,"I get that, I was replying to pre previous guy who said OP can just move their coins to a wallet (presumably) to split them there.

OP would just move their BTC but would not be able to get the BCH that way because BCH has replay protection, right? ",1510828539.0,1,davehzz
dpwkbyl,7dbd1p,"Ahh, thanks. ",1510834541.0,2,davidcwilliams
dpwk0dr,7dbd1p,"yes they can send pre fork coins, it's really very simple when a coin forks. At the exact block it forks you have to imagine an exact copy and paste is made of the ledger so every address and balance now exists on two different chains. They are separate entities so you can carry on using your Bitcoins freely, it doesn't matter if it's pre fork or post fork, Bitcoin is still it's own ledger doing it's own thing. If you move Bitcoins around nothing changes on the new fork, the coins stay where they were at the time of the fork, because it's a separate ledger not connected to Bitcoin it's literally on its own doing it's own thing. If you want to move coins on the fork you have to load their software and use their addresses and actually transact on their chain.

So yes Coinbase can do what they want with pre fork coins, it has no bearing on the new Bcash fork, they are separate, moving Bitcoins will not have any effect on forked coins, they will still sit in the address they were in when the fork occurred.",1510833860.0,2,UKcoin
dpwhwk0,7dbd1p,You are right.,1510828684.0,2,readish
dpwia0c,7dbd1p,"Technically, they're supposed to give you pre-fork coins on a withdrawal if you had those coins in your CB wallet pre-fork. But there's no guarantee that they will do that automatically. You can rest assured that CB has a ton of account holders complaining right now that they don't want to wait until Jan 2018 to access their coins. Whether CB acts on it or not, is an entirely different story. Threatening legal action, if it's worth it to you, is probably the best bet. ",1510829689.0,2,holesinthefoam
dpwkedy,7dbd1p,"Oh. I might have misunderstood what the other guy was saying then. I thought by ""pre-fork"" coins he meant coins that you could still split by other means after you take them out of the Coinbase.

But you're right. If i'm understanding you correctly, pre fork coins are just the main chain coins collectively called that in the context of a fork (forked coins being the fork chain coins), and I've read the term used like that before I just gave it a different meaning because of the context of what the other guy was saying. I'll reassess the other conversation.

Thanks again!",1510834680.0,1,davehzz

dpwimd8,7dbd1p,"I was about to write a whole thing about my skepticism of these pre-fork coins. But then I remembered that coins are a unique string of code and now it makes more sense to me. I have a lot yet to read.

EDIT: I just read coins aren't strings of code they are stored simply as balances on addresses, now i'm skeptical of those ""pre-fork"" coins again. Also I might be misunderstanding what you mean by pre-fork coins, would you elaborate on that first?

EDIT 2: God, my reply is a mess. If i'm being a complete doofus for misunderstanding this whole thread it's gonna feel bad but I shall keep the comments intact, that is, not erase my confusion. That's why i'm adding so many edits. I think now I understand what you were saying all along and I agree (if i'm understanding you correctly).",1510830607.0,1,davehzz
dpwksqo,7dbd1p,"yes everything you wrote above is correct. Some people might worry/think that every bitcoin CB held at the time of the fork is now frozen and cannot be used until people receive their Bcash and that CB can only operate using new deposits and coins that have been moved around after the fork. This isn't the case, CB can use any Bitcoin they like as the balances of the forked coins still exist happily on a separate ledger and aren't effected by origianal chain moves.",1510835463.0,2,UKcoin

- be aware of media manipulation, hype, shit throwing over Bitcoin.

In my opinion almost 90% of all BTC actual users have NO IDEA about what really IS Bitcoin. They need to learn more and be protected against misinformation.  
A good start to read here: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf or https://btctheory.com/scholarly-papers/ or https://www.bitcoinbook.info/, then you can continue with more book, videos and texts, there are plenty on internet.  
- try to learn as much as you can HOW TO USE Bitcoin and wallets, before you start moving large amount of BTC. Use many wallets, learn them and stick with those which serve your habits and purposes. Be aware that there is ""**no best wallet**"" ever. There are only 2 main categories: those which respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F12lpqnug-0) and those which ... don't. If you ignore this important rule you will lose. Categorically!  
Education is the key to success! [""Invest"" in (your) education not in speculation!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uXAbJQoZlE&list=PLPQwGV1aLnTthcG265_FYSaV24hFScvC0&index=18)  
- Try to minimize your use of plastic cards, bank accounts and depend too much of fiat. Start slowly to move towards Bitcoin and be part of r/LivingOnBitcoin. This is the first step to your total freedom from banksters slavery. Spend no more than you could live a normal life, the rest HODL for later.

Ignore the inflammatory topic I chose, I'm not calling either coin child rape, I'm just pointing out that medium is not always good.

In this case, it's a struggle between a more pure Bitcoin implementation modified to perform much better, and a Bitcoin implementation where the ownership of the coin has been separated out into a separate chunk and where the block size is woefully insufficient for the coin to operate as it should.

It's a pretty clear cut case of good coin vs bad coin. And it's worth noting that the people on the side of the good coin - BCH - include people like Gavin Andresen, the #2 guy of Bitcoin if you will who took over from Satoshi. He's endorsing Bitcoin Cash as the better Bitcoin. 

And let's not even get in to the whole corporate connection that is attributed to being the driver behind the perversion of Bitcoin. That just makes things even more clear cut.

They're not mounting an attack on BTC holders. The idea is absurd. However, BCH is trying to dethrone BTC, because BTC has been turned into mutant segwit-coin by corporate interests, and many of the BTC faithful have been duped into defending the attack on Bitcoin that that entails.

BCH only kicked into high gear when Bitcoin Core managed to shamefully propaganda away the 2M block increase that was supposed to go in with segwit (segwit2x). Segwit (the bad part) got in, and 2M blocks (the good part) didn't. At that point it became clear that BTC as it stands is doomed anyway. Something has to be done. Which is no doubt why some seriously bright guys forked BCH out of the block chain before the segwit infection, just in case this became necessary.

It is now necessary, no matter how regrettable.

Really, this is nothing short of a struggle for the soul of Bitcoin.

While the recent drop of the last two days is a combination of: people being trapped into the above p&d, consolidating the loss, and people returning to the Bitcoin a/o moving to other more profitable coins after the last 2 weeks rally, because the ""hype"" is finished (for now at least).

Don't forget that all this started with the BCH in the $350 area (and today still above $1000). In theory it can return back to that area. Also if a good rumor or news comes out, the usual ones can try another pump&dump.

My suggestion is: if you don't know how to ride a pump&dump, don't do it.. you can remain trapped between and lose a lot of money. If you're worried about the volatility... well, you see nothing yet.

It's really quite obvious that it's only a matter of time. In my view, if BitPay and Coinbase announce support, legacy bitcoin is done. BCH price will begin to rapidly appreciate causing the death spiral that we almost saw this weekend if it weren't for the Korean exchange being knocked out and the difficulty adjustment on BCH (which has now been fixed).

On balance, the cost of mining a bitcoin will equal the value of that bitcoin, plus a return on capital.

Seems like a reasonable trade-off to me.

Where do you live that governments don't tax the profits of corporations or individuals today?

> Does this mean that we will eventually end up in a place where Bitcoins are worth 100k or more, however moving them is essentially out of the question, since fees might actually be several thousand? 

Unlikely - scaling solutions will continue to be added (of which SegWit was merely the first).

> eventually we will have smaller and smaller denominations of bitcoin transactions, which makes the byte size of a wallet increase with time, however the value stored in the wallet remains the same. Therefore, transaction costs will always keep increasing.

Yes, as bitcoin value goes up, denominations of bitcoin transactions go down.  Transaction costs are based on transaction size, which is generally independent on the value of the transaction.  The two issues here are orthogonal.

There are many here that subscribe to the Austrian school and similar notions, whereby inflation is not considered to be a good thing.  Keynesian economic theory is generally not well regarded 'round these parts.

dpwj74d,7db61v,"1. Energy cost doesnt mean GDP. Hence it wouldnt be worth the GDP of Denmark. Furthermore, if you look at https://fork.lol/reward/feepct, you can see that at the moment the fees are made up of 80% block reward and 20% fees. This has gone up to 40% during the whole BCH drama and was around 10% earlier. The trend for this has been a steady increase and with decreasing block rewards and my other points I expect this to increase further. I am not merely talking about a regular Tax on profits, but a green energy tax. Considering we are trying to lower our carbon footprint everywhere in the world, especially in China, where they are pushing the green agenda very heavily, I expect that Minning will incur extra taxes. 

2. So to understand this properly, You are saying that regardless of the value of bitcoin, if time tends towards infinity or something large, then the size of any transaction should also tend towards infinity, since it is made up of a combination of inifitely small parts, which all have a finite minimum byte size. Hence any transaction should have an inifnite cost associate with it. This is obviously taking the argument to the extreme and disregarding the fact that there is a minimum transaction value. 

3. There is little point arguing hardline economic theory here, since A) I myself am not versed well enough in it, B) Im pretty sure you arent an economics professor, C) Even if you were, you would have a bias that may not be reflected in reality and D) The most likely correct theory has elements from both supply and demand focused economics, meaning that inflation is an important issue to consider.

A tax is a tax is a tax.  If price of energy goes up, if there is a tax on bitcoin mining specifically, whatever it is, the market will adjust.  What's your point here?

Any idea how much energy the financial sector uses?  

> size of any transaction should also tend towards infinity, since it is made up of a combination of inifitely small parts

No, but kinda.  You can aggregate UTXO, and besides BTC is not infinitely divisible.  But you have stumbled upon another issue with scaling - UTXO set bloat.  Something rarely talked about, but something that will be a problem as BTC value rises and, as you say, average UTXO size shrinks.

dpxc35r,7db61v,"1. Yes and no. So the price of bitcoin has usually gone up to cover the cost of minning, however this metric is diverging evermore. The gap is filled by tx fees. This coupled with potentially increases in extra taxes on mining may be problematic. There is a core difference in the energy use for the financial sector and for bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining is designed to be computationally and energy expensive. The actual hashes being computed are a useless byproduct. It can easily be argued that its simply wasting a lot of energy. Either way, this in combination with reduced block rewards will increase tx cost and will reduce the type of things its economically viable to pay for with BTC. At what point does it no longer make sense to use the currency? Surely there must be a cutoff, for example paying 10% fee of the transaction (I know you cant make such a blanket statement, since it depends on the size of the tx, but lets assume average).

2. Lastly, sure my assumptions of invinitely dividing the value of BTC are obviously incorrect, but they just served to illustrate the fact that utxo keep getting smaller.

> How does aggregating UTXO work then? 

What I mean is that your transaction does not have to be one input, two outputs. You can spend multiple inputs (aggregating smaller uxto). Yes the uxto set will grow over time, like I said, and it's a concern for scaling, possibly even more so than block size.

You can't force major decisions to bitcoin. It affects too many people. You need people to agree to any chain decisions made by the developers, and you have to respect the values held by us.

dpwhs16,7db3f0,"You're conflating two different things, and just making a mess of it all.  No, the signatures are not removed from the blockchain.  Allow me to help.

*(Warning: the following may cause increased understanding of blockchain, segwit, headaches, nausea, cramping and unbounded joy)*

A segwit transaction does indeed contain its signature (aka scriptSig) in binary serialized format (NOT a hash), in a structure called the witness.  If it were a hash, there would be no way to cryptographically verify that the inputs are spendable, as a hash is a one-way function (you can't get the original data back from the hash).

As you mentioned, a block containing segwit transactions does indeed contain a new merkle root hash for the witness data, which is the root hash of a merkle tree of the TXIDs and WTXIDs (which in turn are hashes of the transactions' data).  The reason for this new merkle hash is because segwit transaction TXIDs (WTXIDs) hash everything *but* the segwit inputs.  This new witness merkle hash is stored in a special output of the coinbase transaction.  Much like the block header's normal hashMerkleRoot, this witness merkle root is used to quickly verify that the block hasn't been tampered with.  After all, the block's hash depends on the normal merkle root hash, which in turn depends on each transaction's hash (including the coinbase tx, which contains the new witness merkle hash), which of course depend on the transaction data itself.  Any tampering of the data in any transaction will result in an invalid hash somewhere along the chain of hashes.  

It's not very different at all from non-segwit transactions...it just moves the segwit transaction's scriptSig into a new structure (still inside the transaction), and provides a new, second merkle root hash into the coinbase tx to make up for not using the segwit input in the TXID hashes (which get reflected in the block header's merkle root hash).

If you'd like to see an actual segwit transaction in an actual block, just look at the linked raw block below and search for ""witness"".  Look for one that isn't empty...it will look something like (""witness"": ""02483045022100eec02d6a...""), and you will have found a real segwit transaction's signature script in binary format, in a real block, in the bitcoin blockchain.  I chose a block from about a week ago (493800), that doesn't have too many transactions, so that it's a bit easier on the browser:

I pose to you this question. How long have you been involved in crypto? In the history of this market space, have you seen a new-to-the-scene currency rally $10,000,000,000 worth of volume in a single day? Do you think that's normal? Do you think it might be the most extreme example of hype over a market?

The hype is losing steam. And so is the price. Unless you can generate the same kind of attention storm twice, I doubt to see a rally like that again. You must remember the types of people you have representing that coin. The most known public names aren't really the most favored people. I hated Kimdotcom well before BCH existed. I could go on for hours what I don't like about Craig ""fake satoshi"" Wright.

The only reason people are interpreting the chart and assuming BTC is going to bounce is that they're trading on only fundamentals, forgetting that the game has changed. If you check both BTC and BCH charts, and take all the factual information (not your feelings, not what you want it to be, but the actual facts) into account, you'll see what's happening.

If you lose money here, you really deserve to. I personally am cashed out until the market stabilizes, because I'm not a risky investor and I can't call swings accurately enough to trade them.

I know the general consensus is that BTC will survive everything and last forever, and that this is 'just another phase', but it isn't. This has never happened before, and it isn't just a normal part of the market cycle. Don't do what everyone else is doing, this is why crashes happen in any asset, and why most people investing lose money in any time period they trade - they just follow the public opinion in bull markets, then follow public sentiment until it's too late, and they've already jumped off the cliff.

Good luck.

UPDATE: Deleted from /r/BitcoinMarkets, don't think it can be any more obvious. Listen to what the shills are actually saying - not one of them actually says anything with substance. The entire sentiment is 'bch = shit, btc = great', playing on people's emotions and a traditional 'hodl' mentality. In my years of watching and investing in crypto from the shadows, I've never felt the need to voice my observations this much, but I care for this community and this vision, and I hate to see people burnt by such obvious lies and manipulation. Again - I'm not invested myself, I have only very small holdings in both btc and bch at the moment, and I can't promise any direction of the price, since there are enough coins on both sides to throw the price out of whack in either direction. Regardless, this lack of actual dialogue from the supposed bitcoin supporters (shills) and the nature of their attacks has become too obvious. Please don't get burnt by this, BTC won't be going back up to ATH - ever. You can tip me when I'm right, or hate me when I""m wrong, but don't fall for the propaganda.

I am actually better off in the short term if there is a flippening. I will not sell at the top of whatever. That is for sure. I will also not part with my BTC, not until the Banks takeover and pay me a hefty sum.

Pump and dumps will always happen with every coin. BCH market cap is already high enough to be somewhat safer than other coins. Whales will be whales and we better sit out the madness. Meanwhile people will keep trading BTC for BCH in order to conduct transactions and bringing organic growth in the midst of madness.

dpweuc2,7dazxy,"**Moore's law**

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years. The period is often quoted as 18 months because of Intel executive David House, who predicted that chip performance would double every 18 months (being a combination of the effect of more transistors and the transistors being faster).

I don't think it's a good comparison since the value of bitcoin in 2012 was about $20. Fees are paid in fractions of a bitcoin, so they rise as value rises.

>I dont think the argument for big blocks (that it keeps fees low) stands up to scrutiny.

It does in the short term. I think it's perfectly logical to assume that if bitcoin had bigger blocks there would be less competition for transaction space and therefore cheaper fees. It hard to compare since bcash has nowhere near as many users as bitcoin.

>transaction confirmation time and throughput is a different matter

It stands to reason that if there are more transactions in each block, the average confirmation time would be shorter. With bcash you're practically guaranteed to be on the next block.

If Bitcoin ceases to be useful it will not have any value. Store of value in and by itself does not exist, a good needs underlying utility and it stores value well because predictably, it will hold its utility far into the future: I.e. Gold.

Bitcoin will not cease to be a store of value just because it changed its audience. You could argue that as a settlement layer, Bitcoin will cater to less users but higher paying ones.

In the end, this is just a question of philosophical roadmap.

Myself I support BCH because it goes in line with the revolution of the commons I envisioned. Taking back sovereignty. But I do not expect Bitcoin Core to not be able to fulfill its use as store of value, much like gold, under their present roadmap. And if all my fears come to pass, it will actually be worth a lot for the actors I envision entering the scene. That's why my Bitcoins will stay on the main chain, in a non SegWit address and with no Lightning Channels.

But that is a very narrow vision for Bitcoin and a testament to our collective sheepness and feeble minds... we could indeed have had it all. It isn't however, an economic disaster, it could very well make all the holders very happy moneywise. It will essentially be a bribe.

Given the present roadmap, it could at least bring some transparency to the current financial system (half full glass).

Even if we bump that up to $20; do you really think you can mail a few ounces of gold have it received by recipient on the other side of the world; and then have it tested for counterfeit within a few hours or even days?",1510846246.0,1,45sbvad

The practical solution is this, as I see it:

- There is clearly financial support for BTC and by holding it, you are getting the benefit of a stable store of value and possible upside from the increase in value.   Yes, BTC was meant to be much more than this, but again, think about *your finances* first and foremost.

- When you want to transact, simply move some of your BTC to another crypto currency (such as BCH or whatever) and use it to make day-to-day payments.  After all, you don't need thousands of dollars on-hand to buy your morning cup of coffee.

And just remember, this whole thing is still evolving and will continue to see lots of turmoil.  I'm all for a decentralized, accessible currency and the way things are going, I feel other competitors will start taking a good slice of the pie in the future.

My reason for investing:

Dragonchain is not just a blockchain platform. It's a blockchain of blockchains. Currency agnostic, the Dragon is actually a micro-license that gets you access to intellectual property for sale in the marketplace, early access to ICO projects, and access to incubator services that provide a bridge for non-tech savvy companies who want to use the blockchain technology. It offers each business that wants to use the platform:

* It's own personal blockchain
* It's own custom tokens or currencies
* 5 levels of trust -- from fully private to public -- based on data needs
* Amazon / Google level transaction volume 
* A marketplace of smart contracts, custom tokens, etc.
* An incubator -- with services ranging from legal, marketing, blockchain experts, etc.

If you are are a developer looking for some side work -- you could spend your spare time writing smart contracts for different types of industries and uploading them into the marketplace... And thus you have a platform that feeds itself.

Here is an example of how the demand of the Dragon will be derived:

Company A wants to use Dragonchain platform for all of the services / benefits over competition it provides. Company A is a gaming company, and has no idea how to write smart contracts or launch an ICO. Therefore they hire a consultant from the incubator -- first required use of Dragons (there will be an option for companies to buy Dragons with cash, at a premium price). Next, they determine what kind of ecosystem they want, and are ready to purchase the smart contracts for that ecosystem from the marketplace. This is the next required use of Dragons. I personally asked the CEO how the payment of DRGN would work (in telegram) -- and he said that the developer of the smart contract would determine if this is a subscription fee or a one time purchase. It could even be a small fee for every API call, for example. Once Company A launches their ICO, early investors will need Dragons to be able to get any tokens. 

So the Dragon's utility will be directly proportional to the usefulness/value of the incubator, marketplace and the ICO's launched on the platform. I think it's brilliantly innovative.

dpwfqem,7dar67,"**Exponential growth**

Exponential growth is exhibited when the rate of change—the change per instant or unit of time—of the value of a mathematical function is proportional to the function's current value, resulting in its value at any time being an exponential function of time, i.e., a function in which the time value is the exponent. Exponential decay occurs in the same way when the growth rate is negative. In the case of a discrete domain of definition with equal intervals, it is also called geometric growth or geometric decay, the function values forming a geometric progression. In either exponential growth or exponential decay, the ratio of the rate of change of the quantity to its current size remains constant over time.

Bigger blocks (like with bitcoin {cash}) will allow *millions* of new users. What that means is increased desire to use bitcoin, increased desire to accept it, and also to handle it as a company. This will lead to more mining nodes (increased decetralization) andwill also lead to tens of thousands of new non-mining nodes (no addition to network security or centralization).

When exactly?

>I don't like how centralised bitcoin is at the moment, and that would get worse with bigger blocks. It took me absolutely ages to download the blockchain for a core node... And I have fibre broadband!

That's not because of it being ""Centralized."" That's because of a deficiency in the Core software. When I did a blockchain download, it never used more than about 10% of my CPU, SSD SATA bandwidth, Memory, or 1Gbit internet connection. My computer is 5 years old with 16GB of ram BTW.

> Yea, the fees as are high at the moment. (bch borrowed some hash rate for a while, which increased the number of unconfirmed on bitcoin). But that's reducing now.

Because people are using it less, and there are more than 144 blocks per day. There have been [152 BTC blocks over the last 24 hours](https://btc.com/stats/pool?pool_mode=day) 1.04 MB on average, so a 4% blocksize increase so far.

> Do I like the higher fees? Would I like small fees? Absolutely! But I'm also patient.

And while you're patient BCH is gaining more and more users. Already getting 10% as many transactions per day as BTC has. This means that without BCH, BTC would have exponentially higher fees and even longer delays, and the mempool would never be empty. Either that or ETH would have a $50 Billion market cap instead of the 30 it has now.

> Not many people actually spend bitcoin at the moment

Because it's cheaper to use a credit card, or any other crypto, for that matter.

>so fees aren't a massive concern. 

You're delusional.

>If fees are still high in a year or so, I'd be up for increasing the blocksize

It looks completely unpredictable when that will be. Maybe that won't  happen any time soon. Won't a lot of people need to move to using SegWit addresses for that. Old addresses aren't compatible with SegWit, as far as I understand. So, it's entirely possible - and maybe even the more likelier scenario - that a majority of transactions will not be SegWit transactions even in a years time.

> Also, LN and other things like Schnorr will increase efficiency.

But these these are still a long way off. They don't do anything about the problem now. It'll take months/years before they are deployed. And if SegWit adoption is any indicator, even longer for them to be widespread enough to be useful.

> I don't like how centralised bitcoin is at the moment, and that would get worse with bigger blocks.

But it doesn't help with decentralization if people can't even get into Bitcoin either. Presently, I can run a node on my pretty average desktop (even though it is true t that it will take a few days to download the whole block chain for the first time). But what incentive do I have to even do that if I can't even own any Bitcoin.

That anyone can run a node but no one can use coins because of transaction fees scenario makes no sense to me. Wider usage should surely have more priority than ease of running a node. Not everyone needs to personally run a node to keep the network decentralized and distributed as long as there are enough nodes.

> Not many people actually spend bitcoin at the moment, so fees aren't a massive concern. If fees are still high in a year or so, I'd be up for increasing the blocksize

I can agree with that. But, you see, it's incredibly frustrating for me that I can't buy bitcoins and then transfer it to my own wallet without paying an absurd amount of fees. Transaction fees will keep hurting real-world adoption until it is fixed.",1510817089.0,3,the_S1lence

The size of a non-SW bitcoin transaction in bytes is roughly calculated as:

(# inputs * 148) + (# out * 34) + 10 (range of plus or minus the # of inputs) 

Knowing that, it's only ~192 bytes per transaction for a non script or multi-sig transaction. A Bitcoin transaction with 1 input and 100 outputs is ~3600 bytes. 

Said another way, that could potentially be 100 economic transactions that are only 36 bytes a piece, but are still only counted as 1 Bitcoin transaction. 

277 of these could fit in a 1 MB block, which would be 27,700 economic transactions per block, or 46 etps. 

With 10 MB blocks that's 460 etps, and with 1 GB blocks, which have been tested working, that would be 46,000 etps, or ~4 Billion economic transactions per day!

If some people are stalling or blocking a solution to an immediate need, without any alternate solution being viable for the time being, it is inevitable that a lot of people will go their own way. I think an appropriate example would be the case of OpenOffice and LibreOffice. OpenOffice had everything going for itself until a company, I think it was Oracle, started having too much influence on it's development. That forced people to create the LibreOffice fork. I think the case with BTC and BCH is very similar, with BTC being OpenOffice (with too much influence from Blockstream/Core) and BCH being the LibreOffice variant. 

Also, I think SegWit is just plain bad design. It may or may not be good technologically, I am not saying anything about that. But, being from the design field, I can say it it is an awful solution from just a design perspective. It is unnecessarily complicated and requires work and active knowledge of users to make it work. And when that doesn't happen, as could have been easily predicted, the engineers have to blame users for not using their solutions 'correctly'. Hallmark of bad design.

The problem is BScore and other nefarious actors controlling the main implementation and refusing to increase the block size, making up propaganda against scaling on chain, **doing MASSIVE censorship on the greater part of the community to hide the truth about scaling on chain,** which is seriously derailing progress and causing a huge loss of market share to alts. 

Corrupted core developers are acting in their own self interest at the expense of the community, restricting capacity on chain to create demand for Layer 2 solutions. This also drove the fees way up to an average of $20 and created a backlog that is persisting for weeks. The problem is so obvious.

Corrupted Core devs are also attempting to change the story - Bitcoin is and always was a currency, not this bullshit ""digital gold"" they're trying to push. The digital gold model alone is a ponzi scheme because it relies on a greater fool to buy it from you for a higher price...

https://www.yours.org/content/medium-of-exchange-is-the-primary-function---store-of-value--is-second-1c8651ec8aab

So Bitcoin's roadmap is to restrict on chain capacity to drive fees up, ruining utility of the blockchain, to create demand for L2. **Key point: a majority of the volume on the Segwit1x fork will be taking place off chain, on centralized second layer solutions, which are not based on proof of work.** 

Bitcoin Cash follows the whitepaper and offers massive on chain scaling. Key point: **A majority of the volume on this fork happens on chain, retaining decentralized and censorship resistant properties.**

In the future I imagine transactions will be orders of magnitude higher than they are now (larger than VISA). L2 (in my view) is the only viable way of scaling.

Then, things start to get interesting. Core does not know that it is a segwit key. You have to generate redeeming script for the witness with addwitnessaddress command. But you have to know the key hash of the public key. There are tools avaiable for that but probably the easiest would be to export the wallet to a text file dumpwallet ""filename"" from Core console.

Even if they think they are better off with BTC as the dominant coin, it is not their role as an exchange to actually make a decision as drastic as what you have postulated. 

I think it is still more reasonable to presume that their systems just went through their limits and crashed, much like many exchanges have done in the past during high market activity. 

Interesting hypothesis though but I would require more evidence before we, or at least I, can presume it might be the case.

The battle should be fought with:

- User adoption
- Startup adoption
- Merchant adoption
- Hashpower on mining pool

But last November I decided to do some speculating and, in the course of 6 weeks, bought 3.3 BTC. Then last January I started getting into alts via a local crypto investment club by using some of my BTC. That went really well. Over 10x well.

Today I am more confident than ever that blockchain and other distributed consensus mechanisms will have a huge positive impact on the world and eventually underlie the global financial system. On the other hand I strongly feel that all of the existing public cryptocurrencies are deeply flawed and most, if not all, will not survive very long. I have mostly cashed out and, as always, I consider my remaining positions in cryptocurreny as speculation, not investment. Regardless of how the story turns out in the long run, it has been a wild and fun ride and have enjoyed it immensely and learned a lot.

So if you think politics is going to stay out of crypto ...

As a student still kinda trying to figure out what they want to do, a career with crypto seems really interesting and fulfilling, and it seems like the field is only going to grow. 

If anyone feels compelled, I'd love to hear what kind of job you have, your thoughts about the future of the field, what your typical day is like, and\/or if you have a degree in a related field. 

Thanks!",1510855421.0,9,bakinlettucetomato
dpxa56k,7daiih,"Hey Everyone!
Would love to have your feedback on a product I'm working on which shows real time social media data for cryptocurrencies, and presents it in relation to price.
To make sure we get it right, I would be really grateful for anyone here that will take a few minutes to use our product and give us feedback. If you like it - please feel free to use it. It's free!
You can use it to make in depth analysis about the relationship between price and social media volume, or just quickly look at the strongest trending coins. You can have a quick look at what is actually being said, in order to understand what makes the trend of mentioning of names.
If you have any comments on the social media chatter <> coin price relationship, I'd also like to hear.
If you have any questions, feel free to PM me. Glad to answer anything. Thanks for any help.
You can check it out at https://solume.io/

It can be found here: https://www.bafin.de/dok/10185906

I don't think we'll see a rise in manipulation, as the people (whales) capable of it will already have their ways and places of/for doing it. Not to mention Coinbase is known for playing ball with the Government, so anyone attempting manipulation probably won't be interested in attempting any funny business on an account they have to tie to a real (or illegal false) identity to.

As for growth, I think we'd definitely see some growth in whichever coins get added but not necessarily as an entire market. For a lot of newcomers or crypto noobs that just wanted some BTC/ETH/LTC to hold, the coins offered by Coinbase have a sense of validity and security too them. I imagine a lot of people that aren't addicted to crypto like us and just wanted to make a good investment have just bought some BTC and *maybe* some ETH and/or LTC and just leave it in Coinbase. So, now we have a that new market of users that could see whatever alt coins that may get added and they'll throw some money at it hoping for some O.G. BTC level gains madness. This will then probably have a small, but hopefully noticeable, ripple affect across the rest of the coins with new money being added. But I wouldn't imagine it would make a giant difference.

Transaction fees are necessary when working on exchanges. That's how the exchange itself makes money. There is also a fee for sending Bitcoin, it's not fee-less.

From my experience, Liqui is fairly trustworthy (i.e. they didn't just straight steal your coins), however their infrastructure isn't that great and their response time to fixing things like deposit/withdrawal is terrible, but it will eventually get fixed. As long as you've entered the addresses correctly, you will eventually get your coins.

dpwlzg1,7daiih,"Let me put my reasons, as independent observer of this coin, why it will have high value:

Its a good sign that they have such a low number of coin supply. Higher demand with low supply makes prices high. Its basic economics rule.

100-200$ doesn’t mean that it would happen in a day or weeks. It will take more than 12 months atleast.

The main challenge for coin team is bringing traditional market to use their product. It will create immense demand for this coin and will be traded in decimals. 

Decred is coin with 6mn supply and 200mn market cap
Is there any fraud coin other than bitconnect? It has 2mn supply with 600 cap.
If above coins can reach such huge market caps. Why this genuine coin cant? It has good road map. Its has good team. It has good advisors. It has ministry approvals. It has good market PR. Its way much better than others. 

Finally it has low coins because bitcoin fork and bitcoin cash crushes were happening in market and people avoided new investments and going into alt coins. This resulted in very low investment in this coin. In 28 days this coin got 1.8mn coin sale but when bitcoin fork plus bitcoin cash drama ended, it generated 1mn funds in 2 days.

dpwnnrj,7daiih,"> Its a good sign that they have such a low number of coin supply. Higher demand with low supply makes prices high. Its basic economics rule.

Looking at it as an investment, thats not true at all. I doesnt matter if the coin is 0,10$ or 100$, all that matters is the marketcap compared to the circulating supply. 

> Decred is coin with 6mn supply and 200mn market cap Is there any fraud coin other than bitconnect? It has 2mn supply with 600 cap. If above coins can reach such huge market caps. Why this genuine coin cant? It has good road map. Its has good team. It has good advisors. It has ministry approvals. It has good market PR. Its way much better than others.

While I do agree with you that there are a lot of coins in the top 100 which are worthless/ vapourware, but that doesnt mean that this one is good or better.

>It has good market PR.

Any ""PR team"" that sends out a tweet like that is far from good. Check their website, its also full with grammatical mistakes. Noone proofreads these? Because it seems like no one on the team did.

The idea isnt bad, there is a space where it could possibly work.
But nowadays its gotten pretty popular to make a half-decent whitepaper from a good idea, pump out an ICO and get 30mill for a dead project.

And with this project all I can see is a decent idea whit a whitepaper, a horribly failed ICO (like 10% of tokens sold), shitty PR, and a team thats barely speaking english or doesnt give a shit about the product they put out into the world.

dpwx1rz,7daiih,"I should give a little backround:

I first got into crypto when btc was in mid 3 thousands. 

I ended up building a portfolio I was pretty proud of - It was 55% btc, 25%eth and the rest alts

I turned $300 into $1000 in a few months off a mostly buy in and hold strategy (I made the most off of Neo, then antshares) while I traded the alts (I never lost on a trade and was proud of that... still true) 

And then the best/worst thing happened. They put a btc atm RIGHT behind my house, and I hadn't realized that a big piece of why I was able to find some success in crypto was my inability to quickly liquidate, therefore never factoring it into moments when I needed cash. 

I sodl like an idiot and missed out on another $1000, and that's if I didn't even put more in. 

btc and all numbers felt really high and I was waiting for a time to get back in. It didn't come. 

So a few weeks ago I wanted to get back in and knew that *high* now is *low* later. 

I have thrown a few hundred dollars in, and I have been trading on all of that at a time",1510850474.0,1,H8NforS8N
dpwqh3d,7daiih,"Worthless coins in top 100 doesn’t make it better coin. Similarly low coin supply doesn’t make it bad coin. The reason for low ico fund raising was coincidence with bitcoin fork. As i mentioned its 28 days raise before fork was 1.8mn but in two days after fork its 1mn.

Imagine the graph is a perfect sine wave

If I'm feeling risky I will try to make a call to where it is *going* to move, or outside of the sine wave, but I usually stick to within the range because it's worked for me.

The lack of hashrate really slowed down BTC blockrate. That was a major factor. It was also one of the causes for hashrate to *move* to BCH. Correlated for sure. But causality is a question here.

Part of the reason for the increase in traffic was the cancellation of SegWit2x. This caused a price drop in BTC, a price gain in BCH, plus a lot of genuine BTC-BCH migration. That was especially taxing on the BTC mempool.

They bring a maximum of 1% a year in circulation, so that wouldn't make much sense. Could you give a further explanation? ",1510827078.0,6,redderper
dpwepb2,7dagm2,"I appreciate your reply but you are misinterpreting the stats. 

Lumens held by the foundation are mostly reserved for partners and anchors. they will likely never be traded on the open market even after they are distributed because they will be utilized as liquidity for anchors and institutions. 

They are similar to Ripple in the sense that the company distributes tokens as incentives for partners and to fastrack the integration. So the amount not released is not diluting the value of the distributed tokens. The foundation is only reserving 5% to maintain operations and for R&D，the rest will be distributed over the course of the next decade. （stellar co-founder Jed Mccaleb actually co-founded Ripple prior to Stellar）

Also the stats are not up to date as there are over 17 bn lumens already distributed. I recommend reading the post if you would like to know more about Stellar. hopefully It will help clear up any confusions you had. cheers！",1510820158.0,8,talks_about_stuff
dpweqw0,7dagm2,"I read it. 

I don't really understand how you can think a lumen used for liquidity will never be traded on the open market. That is what you use liquidity for. Can you explain that in more detail?",1510820258.0,4,AlexanderSupersloth
dpwg6eg,7dagm2,"Liquidity is for moving assets across the stellar network. The lumens staked by anchors and nodes will be tied up in settlements and anchors will not dump lumens on the market simply because it provides their business more value than other crypto or fiat and they need to hold a certain amount to run their businesses. This is the portion I was referring to in my last comment.

Stellar does not award lumens to anchors lightly and the amount given is based on the usage and adoption of the project and it needs to be at least a working proof of concept to be considered. Also I'm guessing a lot of these grants probably come with the agreement to not sell for a set amount of time to prevent abuse.

Stripe originally invested 3m to help launch Stellar and were given 2% equity or 2bn lumens. That is worth roughly 70m usd now but stripe has no intention of selling. This is the case with other major partners and anchors as well.


P.S. All due respect I don't really understand how you can claim you read the post and still ask the questions you are asking, unless you read it and did not fully understand it in which case I have tried my best to explain. But I do appreciate you bringing up some common misconceptions for other users and hopefully my sub-par explanation has helped shed some light.

I like to look to history to how these problems were solved before.

Back in the old days, we traded gold.  We used gold because it was the only commodity on earth that had the desirable features that could be used in a currency.  It was rare, it didn't spoil/rust, it was easy to evaluate it's purity and it could be subdivided easily. 

But eventually, gold got to be too heavy to carry.  Transporting tons of gold back and forth across Asia for trade was a huge burden.  So, what did we do?  We invented second layer solutions.  Gold didn't lose value and we didn't have to give it up entirely, we just found easier ways of trading it.

Why don't we use gold now?  There are many reasons.  For one, gold as a currency makes gold more expensive, which makes electronics more expensive.  Two, there is no way of knowing when a giant gold vein in a mountain somewhere will be hit, wrecking the entire economy alongside it.  

What bitcoin does is allow for a perfect gold-like system.  It's rare, can be transported many times more easily and faster, has a hard limit on the amount that can exist, and doesn't impose an undue price burden on any real-world commodity.  But, with on-chain scaling as an issue, we'll have to find fixes just like we did with gold.  Namely, we'll need 2nd layer solutions.  ",1510866632.0,2,Cygnus_X

It would seem to me like keeping several nodes, maybe several thousand nodes, with a full copy of the blockchain is important to the security of the network.  If nodes only kept 1/100th of the chain as a copy, you'd need a minimum 100 nodes just to have 1 full copy of the chain.  And that is without any redundancy.  Meanwhile, 100 nodes with full copies represents a redundancy of 99.  

Total chain size is certainly a problem.  If it grows too large, the only players with full copies would be large mining farms.  That type of centralization seems very dangerous.

dpxn46w,7dafuk,"TLDR: second layer needs hooks into bitcoin (takes space), so cannot be independant like visa to dollar.

Yes, I understand it works perfectly well. It just seems anathema to bitcoin's original remit (anti banks). As others have said any second layer is liable to a ""different rule set"". Fees / corruption / legal issues. 

Ah, I see the point you are making, that ""the original layer"" works perfectly well, and the second enhances it (independently). 

I don't think this is the case with second layer / Lightning network, as it needs 'hooks' on the blockchain, and there are only _so many_ available. Once it relies on a second layer for it's speed / size, then using the original layer would be frowned upon (or banned!) because it has a disproportionate cost to the second layer. 

USD ""doesn't really exist"", so the theoretical ties are fine. Bitcoin actually has to be bolted to something. Again, else it loses it's entire reason for being. 

Ah, hang on, you're saying that's totally fine. An economy of ""I promise to give you a bitcoin"". 

The problem with bitcoin is that it's finite, and it's value moves a lot. USD are created all the time by forgers and banks. It's such a loose system, that it doesn't really matter if they are lost or created. In other words, the promise (of a bitcoin) _had better be a real frickin promise_. And who audits that/those [it can't be a bank, as that's centralised and offers no benefit, and it can't be a crypto because that can't scale]. I think you're back to square zero really. 

I'd need convincing that a second layer could only be tied 'with a promise' and no real (cryptographic/solid) hook. 

thanks for the thoughts. 

To come back to my original point, I still think that a second layer (a bolt-on) creates a pointless mess that solves and creates problems in varying ratios. 

though it's true that using bitcoin's ""foundations"" (user base/brand) it's easier to make something work, than start a new ""thing"" entirely. ",1510876888.0,1,inteblio

dpwchek,7daei7,"> Market cap of gold is of the order of 7 trillion USD. Let's say Bitcoin replaces even 25-30% of this. That's a 2 trillion dollar market cap. There will only ever be 21m bitcoins. At least 2-3m are forever lost. So 2T/18m = 111k/Bitcoin. That's one way to look at it.

Thanks for your answer. Thoughts on this - I don't think the limited number of potential bitcoins does anything to define its potential value however. It doesn't matter whether there is a limit of 200 coins or 200 million, their value is still based upon speculation and public sentiment. 

Thinking now, it would be interesting to calculate the estimated total cost of energy usage to mine all 21 million bitcoins, I wonder what the figure would be.",1510815348.0,1,jbck
dpwd4uh,7daei7,">It doesn't matter whether there is a limit of 200 coins or 200 million

Sure, per unit is just easier to understand.

>value is still based upon speculation and public sentiment.

I think short term value is driven by speculation for sure, but ultimately if this continues to take off, the potential is massive. If you spend some time understanding  decentralized cryptocurrency, you might (like me) conclude one day that the concept is revolutionary and we are at the dawn of the next big thing like the Internet was back in the day. Valuation under that framework and mindset is where the gold and money supply comps come in.

Also, you might find it very useful to watch some of [Andreas Antonopoulos' videos.](https://www.youtube.com/aantonop)

> Thinking now, it would be interesting to calculate the estimated total cost of energy usage to mine all 21 million bitcoins, I wonder what the figure would be

This is going to depend on how much mining hashrate ultimately comes into play. I think I read somewhere that the current bitcoin network consumes about 350 MW of power (roughly 1 Watt/Gigahash/sec currently), which isn't too bad (less than a single typical baseload power plant).",1510816692.0,1,wittysoul76

I would recommend storing your coins on the ledger for any significant amounts.

In particular, this part:

> Looks good, right? Wrong, if you consider the fact that the method how EC parameters have been selected is not quite clear. To be more exact, it was not clear how a seed has been chosen to generate a curve parameter.

> It means that a statement about P-256 being ""verifiable random"" is simply not true and a D. J. Bernstein's note in a TLS WG discussion confirms that and provides a hint about Jerry's employer involvement in this case as well.   

> The common suspicion here is that Jerry has tried many of them until found a weak EC curve that can be exploited in the same way as in Dual_EC_DRBG case. Since there is an opinion that there might be a ""spectral weakness"" in ECC (check also this), that suspicion seems quite plausible. ""Spectral weakness"" means that there is a uniform (?) distribution of weak EC curves that can be eventually found through enumeration in a reasonable time interval.

If you assume a large percentage of the world is using bitcoin by 2140 when no more bitcoins are minted, we are talking massive profits on fees even though individuals pay next to nothing, the cumulative sum of the fees would be astronomical.

I don't think the Bitcoin price will ever really ""settle down"" without government intervention. This is an unregulated market where big players get to play the games they aren't allowed to play in regulated exchanges.

",1510809950.0,4,BlenderdickCockletit
dpwcsdm,7da94z,"There are two options for miner to get rewarded:

* Adding a ""NULL pays MINER X coins"" transaction to the block they are working on (generated coins).
* Inserting their address as the recipient of the fee offered by transactions that have included them (transaction fees).

All the nodes currently agree on how big X is based on the current numbers of coins. *Miners get to chose what transaction they will include in the block they are processing*, so as X in forced down, they will stop including 0-fee transactions. This will encourage people to include fees in their transactions to get them added to the blockchain. Right now it might cost a miner (let's say) .5X in electricity to successfully get a block on the chain so they are willing to include 0 or low-fee transactions. As X is forced down by the network it will eventually cost more to mine a block they it's worth. At this point mines will start reserving more and more space in their block for transactions that have offered fees, until SUM(fees) + X > electricity cost for the block. When all coins are mined, x = 0 and it will just be  SUM(fees) > electricity cost.

This *does* leave the possibility of *nobody* volunteering to create fee-bearing transactions and that would indeed remove all* incentive for miners to process blocks leading to the whole thing shutting down. However, that is very unlikely as it is against the interests of all parties involved to have money that can't be spent **and** if miners shutdown the flow of valid blocks on the chain slows down, thus the hash problem gets easier, reducing the cost to process a block. Assuming Bitcoin still exists at that time, it will be a notable day, but by that time the fees will already have smoothly increased to compensate the miners.

*Some altruistic people (with a fusion reactor in the back yard) may still run mining nodes configured to accept 0-fee transactions because they want to support the network.

I see BCH as the flea inside an elephants ear. After crossing a bridge the flea says 'boy we shook that bridge up'.

Edit: Like any investment you want people to invest with good reason. The pump on BCH last week was not organic and only tricked users to buy in. Those same users will not hold so you'll notice a slow bleed down, which due to bchs new DAA means they will bleed miner support. So they basically have a scenario where they need to convince the market to hold or spend a lot of money propping it up. In many ways their older eda worked better as it basically bribed the miners to stay and everyone payed for it through inflation (easier pill to swallow since you pay collectively for it). Now only by having personal skin in the game can the miners be tempted to mine the coin. This is far harder to convince users to do.

Yes, and there are a standard set of techniques for managing this volatility risk  

> So are they withdrawing right away?

Holding as little as possible  
Converting to fiat currency as often as necessary to minimise risk of sudden devaluation of held Bitcoins  
That is one of the risk management techniques  

The others are:  

* setting Bitcoin prices according to the prevailing exchange rate, minute by minute  
* adding a price buffer to cover the risk of sudden fluctuation  
* setting a time limit for payment - a few minutes or a few hours, depending on transaction value

> If the use of cryptocurrencies means less people will start transacting in USD doesn't that mean the US government will ban crypto because the value and demand for dollar will fall?

I still think you guys had a much better chance with the old one. That gave you a much larger window to rob BTC of it's hash power before the adjustment would trigger.

With this one, the % of your price in relation to bitcoin is going to be around the same as the % of hash rate you manage to take away. So like right now you see it sitting at 1.5 Exos, compared to bitcoin sitting at it's 9.4 Exos. Funny the price is 0.156 right now.

I know it's not exact, but under this adjustment scheme, the lower your price goes, the more hashpower will abandon you. If you want your scheme to work, you have to bust above 1:1 ratio.

If you think the majority of us are buying bitcoin to use it as regular currency you're missing the entire point on why many of us love crypto to begin with. Transaction costs are..mehhh.

Your old difficulty adjustment was vastly superior. Sure you'd have blocks frozen for 12 hours at a time, but holy shit could you guys divert hashpower to milk that shit. Just look at past history. This was much much more impressive. You guys downgraded with the most recent fork. The only way to break Bitcoin with this is to have your price rise above 1:1. You really need to flip it to win. 

I don't think you can pull it off. ""Sometimes"" fucking over the BTC hashrate is better then ""Maybe"" fucking over the the BTC hashrate in my opinion. It was a much easier game to play. I think ambition clouds judgement in this matter.

You absolutely require the assumption that all the miners will all act as 1. That they have no desires for anything besides profit. If you're making any anti-centralization claims about BCH, this absolutely spits in your face. And quite frankly... I don't think that's true. I think people would choose to mine BTC core, because they beleve in it. And because it would be seen as an act of resistance against a group of people that openly say they desire the destruction of Bitcoin.

I got a wallet, looked into BTC  and tried to mine it with the wallet I downloaded (didn't work at all).

These are two transactions.

The first is your long term sale of your XYZ to ETH. Your proceeds are calculated from the fair market value in USD of XYZ (or ETH). Use the Coinbase spot price or other daily value, for example, from bitcoinaverage.com.

The above also sets the cost basis of ETH, so when you (almost immediately) sell it to USD there are likely no gains since it won't have gone up in that time. Actually, it would probably be a loss when you add in the fees, which can then be deducted from your total net gains for taxes.

Clearly you need to backtrack, because I was correcting the person who initially replied to you. You started this conversation with me.

Blockstream was founded by a few of the core developers and other Bitcoin enthusiasts. Go look at the bitcoin core github. Look at the developers that commit, that comment, that do pull requests. Notice how many different names you see? They're not all employees of Blockstream(hell most of them aren't even), but you have never looked at it, have you? Now go check all bitcoin cash githubs.

https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited

https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc

https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt

Do you see what I'm getting at? The development and community isn't there behind Bitcoin Cash. 

Look at these pull requests(not closed just open and recent), issues and everything.
Core:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin
Even lightning main github:

No doubt many of these low caps will out produce the large caps in terms of profit yields... However the smaller the cap, the larger the risk (generally speaking), and with new coins popping up like something that pops up a lot, it's not exactly easy to pick the winners and avoid the losers.

Personally I don't think BTC/ETH are going down anytime soon, so I see them as more or less guaranteed(figuratively speaking) money maker, even if they won't produce as much as the small caps that end up rising.

It being placed in SegWit and not USD after that last sell of BTC makes me think that it isn’t roger but maybe one of the other billionaires who want BCH to get the success it deserves. 

In this situation BCH is like the people vs the BTC elites. They have their impenetrable Core dev team who have a plan for their version of bitcoin set in motion. They don’t want to see BCH succeed. They know there can only be one when it comes to hash-power, So are trying really hard to make BitcoinCash and the people who support it look bad. Creating sock puppet twitter accounts, faking forks to confuse people interested, trying to manipulate peoples view any way they can. Luckily people are slowly waking up to how bad fees can be and confirmation times, as well as how Bitcoin has been hijacked, and is now the equivalent to E-Corp Coin. 

Not to mention this Bitfinex and Use of Tether to inflate BTC issue we have going on.  They know if it keeps going up people will keep buying. 3200-7800 in less than 30 days... 🤔. You can look at the charts and see little “Spooky” in action. 
They won’t be running for much longer, people are catching on.

I see Roger as the Bobby Fisher of Bitcoin right now. I think he’s been calculating this very carefully with Jihan since he found out the fork happened. They have not only their little chess plays mapped out, but an actual organic group of people who see the lies and manipulation going on from the Cult of Core, but People who are new to Bitcoin are realizing this. I have new people ask me more now how to buy Bitcoin Cash then bitcoin because they heard its “straying away from what it was supposed to be.”
(True story, someone actually new to bitcoin said that to me yesterday)

We all want to see Bitcoin be what we got into Bitcoin for... To be able to spend it, cheaply, however we want, and a store of value so it can also be used for us to be our own bank. Technology needs utility to be useful though, and high fees and slow confirmations isn’t useful for the everyday person.

dpwkosz,7d9xlq,"Here's how I think about this. Put yourself in a highly principled whale's shoes whose first priority is not to make a lot of money on the fork arbitrage trade but to ensure BCH emerges victorious.

Without this whale's help the price will either eventually 

- go higher, or

- go back down past where last weekend's surge began

If his main goal with this is to ensure BCH succeeds, why would he buy now when his buying may not even be necessary because the price will eventually go up and up without his help? Keeping his powder dry lets him move that huge wall up to $1200, then $2400, then $4800 where it can be of great use in the final showdown if he is willing to take some losses to ensure BCH wins. 

And if the price is destined to go down if he doesn't step in because there are a ton of people and exchanges who want to sell, he may as well wait for it to go lower so he can get more BCH-supporting bang for his buck by depriving as many sellers as possible of their BCH at the lowest possible price that doesn't go below support at $600. 

That's why the buy wall is at...$600. If $1000 holds as support without his help and then we get another surge, my guess is he will move the wall to $1000. Like a ratchet.

What scam? That was a short time spike and dip, there are dips and there are spikes in every currency.

Smart investors should buy the dips, people who bought at 2500 had FOMO and they risked their money, and they haven't lost anything yet (unless they sold).

I have no doubt that bch will go up to that price and more and the wall just confirms it.

He showed me multiple bank statements, as well as letters from banks and lawyers.
I'm sure that all the current withdrawal problems at MTGOX are being caused by the traditional banking system, not because of a lack of liquidity at MTGOX.
The traditional banking partners that MTGOX needs to work with are not able to keep up with the demands of the growing Bitcoin economy.
The dozens of people that make up the MTGOX team are hard at work establishing additional banking partners, that eventually will make dealing with MTGOX easier for all their customers around the world.  For now,  I hope that everyone will continue working on Bitcoin projects that will help make the world a better place.

LN routing is made via the onion protocol meaning that hubs have no idea who is transacting with who. Hubs have no control over who is transacting with who. Hubs do not control your funds.

1) Everyone speculates that it's his buy wall. Many people ask him about it.

2) He says nothing despite being active here daily.

3) He posts this.

I don't see any problem with showing people that you are serious about Bitcoin Cash. He is well connected and likely knows the price will jump around for a while before it goes higher, since this first surge was a shot across the bow for BTC and the ecosystem is scrambling to come to grips with it. It will take time. The price could easily retest $600 before going to $2000 and beyond. This order puts a big solid floor under the potential downside for traders and holders for as long as it is there. Even if later pulled it puts at least a temporary floor on lowball bids, forcing lowballers to buy above 600 if they want any action during a big dip.

And to speculate further, Roger has so incredibly much money in Bitcoin and is clearly someone driven by principle that it's not likely he is doing this in an effort to make money, but in an effort to help BCH succeed. Think about it: if the price can go up without him having to buy anything, he can later  place just as big a wall at $1200, then at $2400, then at $4800 when BTC and BCH may be near parity in a final showdown. That would be the place to burn one's money by placing a floor on his allies' downside, if possible. And if the price doesn't go up without him buying  at market price, he can kee his powder dry   for  that eventuality. 

In short, his action is likely to be intended to suggest a guarantee of a price floor for BCH. And hey, if BitMEX or Gdax want to give him tons of cheap coins and make him a billionaire instead of just a hundred-millionaire, he's probably fine with that, too.",1510832565.0,13,ForkiusMaximus

dpwk60h,7d9xlq,"Yes I know about the timeout. All channels are at the most basic created as a set of [nLockTime](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/NLockTime) transactions.

You send a timelocked transaction of say 0,05BTC to the hub and the hub at the same time sends a 0,05BTC transaction to you. Then you trade signed channel states between yourselves that redistribute the 0,1BTC between yourselves. Every transaction contains multiple payout scripts though. If you publish you transaction the counterparty get's the money instantly and you have to wait a set amount (perhaps a week). If the counterparty publishes his transaction its the other way around. If you both want to close the channel you can both publish and the channel is instantly closed.

The key point is that every new state also contains the keys to a second script in the previous transaction giving you access to all the funds of the earlier counterparty transaction. So if you counterparty transmits an old transaction you will instantly get your part but you also have the key for their part giving you the entire channel content. This keeps both of you honest because you loose all your funds if you try to cheat.

The security risk here is that if your counterparty publishes an old state you only have the time out, the week I mentioned earlier, to detect and publish your transaction. 

So in a ridiculous scenario the counterparty in some way manages to keep you from detecting and publishing a transaction in this timespan. The reward function of this behavior isn't logical though. If the counterparty manages it he has stolen all the channel funds. But channels are supposed to be small and hubs are supposed to make money by having a lot of channels. As soon as a hub renegades on any channel it will lose all the other channels and it's very likely to lose the full amount in your shared channel.

For a global system of currency like bitcoin aim to be it will of course require larger blocks. Currently though it doesn't. It's more important to get L2 and even L3 up than it is to mindlessly increase the blocksize.

It's *not* Bitcoin, but it copied the name. People have a hard enough time wrapping their head around Bitcoin as it is, this just makes it all that much harder. 

And with mainstream wallets such as blockchain.info adding support for BCH, you can expect not only confusion, but loss of funds due to mistakes. (such as sending your BTC from another wallet to a BCH wallet there)

Of course I have no evidence for believing that, so I would never say that's how it went down outright.

 But you have to admit, that losing a 10 billion market cap in 5 minutes due to a ""server crash"" is one helluva coincidence, isn't it?

In the end, all of this probably won't even matter. Because even if BCH causes confusion, I think we're eventually heading to a world where people use Bitcoin, but it will be buried so deep in the layer stack that most people won't even know they're using it.

What I mean by that is. I think of Bitcoin just as a protocol in the future. It will be up to the developers to implement that protocol into more user friendly GUIs.

I create new money called ShitCoin, and it consists of the 100 pairs of soiled underwear laying on my bedroom floor (I don't wash my clothes a lot).  I give them away to 100 people.  One person comes along and buys one ShitCoin from one holder for $1.  Money supply of all ShitCoin is $100.   DummyDumDum comes in with a $100 bill from his $10,000 stash, and wants to buy ShitCoin.  For some reason that economists and people of good taste everywhere do not understand, nobody wants to sell for $1 or $2 or $5 or even $10.  Two people finally decide $50 is their selling point.  

Is the value of the money supply of ShitCoin now $101?  No.  It is now $5,000.

Now suppose that DummyDumDum has an epiphany and comes in with a $10 bill and half of all ShitCoin holders suddenly realize they are holding shit and decide to sell for whatever they can get.  So 50 people sell their ShitCoin for $0.20 each.  Is the value of the money supply now $11?  No, it is $20.

In other words, the money supply of ShitCoin is not strictly determined by how much money flows into the system, but also on the willingness of the people who own it to sell at varying prices.  This makes OPs thumbnail calculations laughably simple and almost certainly incorrect when they don't account for it.

Worse yet, a net 53 people actually voted that stupid shit up.  And you are defending it.

Debt-based money has been working surprisingly good for many decades in a second-industrial and post-industrial setting. The problem with it is political, not economical. It is a system that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, so it can only work as long as the elite stays benevolent. More fundamentally: the merit distribution is quite static, while the wealth distribution has its own induced dynamics, so before some point, the rich are the capable, but after that point, this disaligns and you have ""stupid rich"", that is, an elite that is much more wealthy than what would correspond to their merit, or equivalently, much less capable than what would correspond to their wealth status.

dpwakv1,7d9w4x,"This is a surprising (to most) reason why miners are incentivized to keep Bitcoin price low. People assume that miners want Bitcoin to rise, but the truth is that miners want to keep Bitcoin low, until the equipment they have is obsoleted or too damaged/degraded.

As Bitcoin price rises, locations which in the past, could not support mining profitably (due to higher electricity cost) can now support mining.  Thus, as Bitcoin price rises, hashpower rises.  As hashpower rises, difficulty rises.  As difficulty rises, the earnings of an existing miner (denominated in BTC) with fixed hashpower decreases.

Indeed, the cost of mining will rise to approach the earnings of mining.  Thus mining approaches a strategy similar to fiat cost averaging, with the difference that you have a capital outlay at the start, whereas in a ""pure"" fiat cost averaging, you have no initial capital outlay.

Thus, if you had a choice between the below:

1.  Take some fiat money, buy BTC, and HODL BTC.
2.  Take some fiat money, buy miners, and mine BTC.

If you had taken the first choice, your incentive would be to increase Bitcoin price by whatever means (teaching Bitcoin to others, creating businesses that accept and trade in Bitcoin, creating technology to improve Bitcoin usability, and so on).  But if you had taken the second choice, your incentive would be to suppress the price of Bitcoin (but not so much that you would not be able to mine profitably: you want Bitcoin price to be just above your profitable-mining level, to keep competitors out).

Hence the pattern you see, where miners spread FUD and do things that suppress Bitcoin price, while ex-miners (the Core devs, for example) do things that improve Bitcoin price, are simply the incentives of the system playing out.",1510811964.0,3,ZmnSCPxj

dpwt2rs,7d9uyp,"It's been awhile since I've done an in-depth write-up, so I thought I'd start by zooming out a bit to take a look at the monster ascending channel that's been keeping the market in check:

https://imgur.com/a/f1ZVv

As far as channel resistance goes, it's currently sitting at around $8060 and rising steadily. Support is now all the way down at around $4200, also rising steadily. 

As you can see, the most recent correction down to around $5500 barely even made it to the middle of the channel before buyers piled on to push price back up into the $7000s. 

If you look back at previous failures to break out of the channel to the upside, this behavior is actually fairly consistent. Market pumps to the top, pulls back a little, pumps back up and makes a new high (but fails to break out to the upside), and then finally concedes and makes its way to the bottom.

So if I had to make a call, I'd say that's most likely what's happening on this most recent bounce from $5500. The market still likely has a little more room to the upside in the next few days, but I'd expect a move on $8000 to be rejected if it comes to that. 

There's also a strong possibility that the market will double top at approximately $7600 and this is more or less the last of the rocket fuel the market has in the tank from the bounce off $5500.

So, that's what I ""expect."" Now let's talk about the unexpected.

Channel resistance is a mere 8% or so above current price at $7500. $600 may seem like a lot, but the market can move 8% in an hour (and has done so on multiple occasions). So it's certainly possible that the market will find the strength it needs to blast up and out within the next few days. And hell, it could even be in the next few hours.

So, as always, we have the three possibilities of ""up, down, and sideways."" So what to do?

If you're longing right at this moment, I'd argue you're being rather reckless. It's more or less a repeat scenario of the last time the market was hovering around $7500 and I advised caution. While there's some upside potential, it's not going to be much unless channel resistance breaks. The far better trade is to long after a break of the channel and a subsequent confirmation of resistance-turned support. 

If I'm right, and the market does lose steam here, shorting is still unfortunately going to be a bit of a risky position because of the upside potential between $7500 and $8060. So I'd hold off on that for now and reassess if the market does make a failed last-ditch yolo effort to break resistance. If that never takes place, then a breakdown from [this wedge](https://imgur.com/a/x1GEg) would be a great shorting opportunity.

Since it's a parallel channel, the market doesn't technically ""have"" to break out of it **ever**. But remaining within the channel indefinitely is pretty unlikely. In just 18 months, channel support will be at $100K, and while nothing is impossible, even the most bullish of the bulls would argue that's a bit of a stretch in such a short period of time.",1510846507.0,70,_chewtoy_

More signs of price being over extended are in my post history.  Also now we have a TD Sequential ""13"" (overbought signal) on 4 hour.

HOWEVER I am still bullish because there are no signs of divergence on the RSI or Macd (unless you go all the way to the 5 minute timeframe).  So no momentum shift yet.

I wish we had pulled back a while ago and gone sideways for a while.  It would be healthier.  That way we could build technical support and move up slowly to ATH.  

Read no further unless you are ready for **conspiracy theory**!  The way we launched up makes us weak here.  It almost looks intentional.  Here is the CONSPIRACY:  BCH pumpers are painting the charts to prepare for a BCH pump in thanksgiving.  Roger pumps price then paints a double top on bitcoin or a blow off top.  Going into thanksgiving weekend while banks all closed he dumps bitcoin hard and pumps BCH.  That would coincide with a climax in BTC difficulty, slow blocks, high transaction fees perfectly because BTC is due for a difficulty adjustment after thanksgiving.  Up until that difficulty adjustment, bitcoin is more vulnerable.  Attacks on BTC price work best when the price is over-extended and has little technical support (ex: whenever china decides to ban bitcoin it always happens to be a point of technical weakness, over extended price with momentum slowing).  I know this is very conspiracy-ish but it is part of my attempt to stay a step ahead of Jihan Wu and Roger Ver.  I just want to be prepared.",1510864225.0,48,joyrider5

Yeah 4 hour doesnt look great right now with the shooting star, decreasing volume, 2 hour bear div, etc.

And **Point and Figure** https://i.imgur.com/cXAAKMM.png shows we need to retrace to 6900 at least maybe all the way to 6k.  On point and figure we still in range between 5435 and 7776.  Big range.

But this bull run could continue.  We just got 15 min stoch cross up (great buy signal during a bull run).   About to get 30 stoch cross.  We are crazy bullish.  We already well above the 78% FIB from prev ATH to bottom of this dip and when we get there we usually push ATH shortly after.  I think the market wants to make an ATH.

Heres the bear argument though... It all relies on breaking this lower purp support line: https://www.tradingview.com/x/aQs4vSzE/  Once we break that support we should retrace a significant portion of this bull run as we failed to build support during this sharp rise.  I wouldnt sell/short until we break that support trendline.

I'll be honest, I missed my entry in the mid 5000's and was pretty sure it would revisit the lower trend line. I started scaling back in between 6500 and 7000 and am mostly back in now. I sold in the low 7000's, and made a small fortune on the BCH pump, so I'm not mad.

It is totally possible that we are in for a second retest of upper resistance line, and *then* fully correct. It would be consistent with this years fractal. [Chart, BCTUSD 1D](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ynfbB2G2/). Watch out for MACD
bearish divergences on the 4H to the 1D charts. Ive been shoving this down everyone's throat as the most reliable indicator of a short term top, and I believe this will continue to hold true.

*However,* given the extremely bullish / FOMO-inducing circumstances lately, I'd say that's not very likely. It's more probable that 5500 was our low for now. That would suggest we are truly going parabolic: we've been obeying our upper trend line for now, but have not come close to the lower support line since July. The September correction to 3k could have been rationalized as previous ATH acting as support, hence not fully correcting to bottom of the channel, but this time we didn't even reach 5k.

[Chart number 2](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HHHE58wS/)

What does this mean? It means people want in, and don't fucking care at what price. Everyone wants a piece of the pie. Institutions, consumers, everybody.

dpxhvd4,7d9uyp,"I want to talk about ""$10k"" for a minute.

It's been the poster child for ""moon"" for nearly four years now. When we shot up from $200 to $1k, people naturally started calling for $10k. Here we are, four years later, and it might actually happen. Let that sink in for a moment. 

However, and I don't wish to be a ""concern"" troll or be overly cautious, but ""$10k"" has been a *lot* of people's ""cash out point"" for a while now. It was for me as well... but then I started thinking and realizing that ~$8k wasn't all that damn different, and by sticking around I was risking *everything* for what amounted to a potential 25% gain (i.e., the difference between selling at $10k or $8k). Not really the risk / reward profile I'm looking for in crypto. In other words, I had doubled my money nearly *five* times. I was 80% to my goal in a linear manner, and nearly 83% there in a log fashion (considering I had completed more than four of the five original needed ""doublings"" to meet my goal"").

And let's face it... that was an ambitious goal. Keeping *all* my liquidity and sanity tied up in this thing for years and years had taken it's toll. As much as I knew in my heart of hearts that $10k was coming... I could no longer stomach the risk. As rare as a potential catastrophic event may be (coins stolen, weakness in ECDSA, weakness in the RNG in my hardware wallet, etc), the *cost* of those events became too high. I decided that I had gotten ""far enough"" along, and that it may even be *stupid* to continue having the exposure I had for such a small additional potential gain.

Now. Here's my point. As rare and snowflake-ish as we all think we are, I'm always surprised to find out there are *many* others in the *exact same boat* as me, at any given point in time. I'm wasn't, and won't be, the only one that decided to sell a little ""early"". As much as I'd like to think we'll plow past $10k and continue on our merry way.... I think it's going to put up one hell of a fight. And perhaps even *getting* there is going to be a fight. I mean, if you've been holding for *years* and your target was $10k and the price is $9,600.... are you really going to keep your dick in crazy for another four percent?

And so begins people jumping in front of other people, satisfied with their gains and taking a *large* amount of profit at or around a critical point anyways. Yikes. I don't think $10k is the end all be all, but we may see a 6 month slog the likes of which we are unfamiliar with recently. There is going to be a lot of profit taking at $10k.... *unless* we can zoom past it quick enough to get those wanting to sell at $10k to take a gamble. Not likely.... but it could happen.

So, just be careful as we approach $10k. There are plenty of people out there looking at that number, and they'll soon realize that $9,200 and $10k are effectively the same thing (for anyone holding since the low hundreds). They'll start leapfrogging eachother, eating liquidity on the books... and you'd probably *really* have to be crazy to place big buy orders in the $9k range anyways. So, I have a feeling we'll see a combination of a lot of ""profit takers"" and a thin buy-side that will mean we either bounce hard off $10k, or approach but fail to get there, perhaps falling back to $7,000 or so before consolidating over months and taking another stab. But if there's ever a chance for a double top or DCB, it's off the bounce from the rejection of $10k.

TLDR; bullish long term (6-8 months +), but could be chop or volatility in the mean time. $10k is gonna be a sick son of a bitch, and we'll see a lot of sell pressure on the way to it as old timers with dreams cash out a little early from their ""$10k"" targets.

The last time I did any ETH trading, I was shorting it at sub $10 just before it went on that mad tear.  During that rise, everyone was expecting a correction.  A lot of traders in here lost money shorting it.

I don't think those were bad calls--they were just premature (..it's easy to get ahead of ourselves in here).  My opinion is that it never really corrected, and I think it still will.  That's been my expectation since it broke $50.  Still waiting, I guess.

So, fast-forward to today.  ETH is inside of a pretty sizeable consolidation wedge that goes back to the Spring.  It's only got about a week left before it exits that wedge, in one direction or the other.

(Now, the part about BTC)

Imagine if BTC consolidates or even inches upwards for the next week.  After what happened last week, the ""clear skies"" ahead, yadda yadda... there are enough reasons to be bullish for me.  Picture a truly vertical move, as so many people are eager for.  I'm not necessarily predicting that, but a $10k coin one week from now wouldn't exactly be the weirdest thing I've seen BTC do this year.

It just seems to me that a ETH busting down into its overdue correction could be a nice catalyst to send BTC over the fence and into the neighbor's yard.  Or vice versa (i.e., BTC's long-anticipated vertical move is what finally breaks ETH's wedge).  Given the liquidity between cryptos, it's easy to picture these two events being one tandem move.

Ok, so we're not really at that level of media attention yet. But the rise is undeniable. Constant CNBC coverage. Jim Cramer talking about bitcoin. Still limited to financial sections and not front pages where *everyone* sees it. Most people still haven't heard anything about bitcoin in four years.

Just this week, I've also had people I know suddenly start coming out of the woodwork to ask me about it. All of them feel they've already missed the bitcoin boat. It's a shame we haven't switch to microbits, I am positive they wouldn't feel that way if prices were quoted as $0.0075 per microbit. They're looking to make mad profits on ICO's still. I warned them they were gambling with ICOs and they might as well go to Vegas. My advice was that bitcoin is still a good buy and the only alt I think is undervalued is maybe Monero. Nobody knew or cared much about bitcoin forks.

These are signs of unbridled enthusiasm. People are looking to play the game, the game is fun right now because it's easy to make money. A new wave of participants is coming in.

I think the superexponential blowout is coming. It could happen in two weeks, or two months. I expect the usual bubble formation - blowoff top, 50-80% drop, dead cat bounce, steady decline.

I suppose I have to go ahead and guess the top even though it's pulled straight out of my butt - I think another doubling of price to $15k is well within reach. The BCH drama is likely behind us and that's a huge bullish sign for more sophisticated investors. They'll pump it enough for the masses to take notice, even though the masses are totally ignorant of the issues.

I suppose I should also guess at what the ""post bubble"" value of bitcoin is. I'd say lower than today, not much. Maybe in the 4-6k range.

dpwr28z,7d9uyp,"Hey, does anyone have any thoughts on using reckless leverage to minimise recklessness? This is a general question- the market today should matter too much



What I was thinking of for now is how to automatically some Yolo trades for a reasonable chance of success. Not a big deal if I get stopped out 10 times in the next couple days. Just want to try something with reasonable  odds and try it in a way that maximizes odds. My feeling is we will be in for a bit of chop, 6500-6700 up to about 7800. Could be down to 5k  or not down at all. I'm rubbish at predicting.  If we drop is almost certainly miss the bounce.

Low leverage not worth the risk atm. High leverage might be. Limit orders are likely not going to be hit or immediately stopped. A few bitmex buy stops seems plausible so as to catch a bounce on the way up seems plausible, but I haven't used them before. Does anyone know if this is likely to work?

I was thinking that without knowing in advance where a bounce would occur (bottom could be way below trigger) to set order about 1.5% above trigger. More? Less. Don't mind losing some gains,  but want to avoid being stopped. Need to confirm it is rising but catch it before it potentially stops rising.

50 times or 100 times leverage here? 100 leaves no margin for error, but this entire idea is a crapshoot on price direction anyway. 2 times one hundred next to each other might be better than 1 50? Less than 50 will end up too pricey for gambling. 

And does anyone know of a way to get info on how many times particular price points have been hit? Can't get it off a chart - need small scale volatility..

Or anything else to suggest?

A bummer in hindsight, but at the time I couldn't make definitive sense of it all. Still can't actually. Congrats to those who successfully rode those swings! 

I have to think we're due for a retrace to some extent after this rise from ~5500. The current support trend line doesn't seem sustainable especially now that we're approaching long term resistance. https://imgur.com/a/Ta3AM

This years previous peaks tapped the resistance line twice before before beginning a correction down to the bottom of the channel. So still a chance we could see a large dip after this second long term resistance line touch. But the more people that expect a large dip the less likely it will happen, and a lot of people expect one. Once a predictable pattern emerges, it no longer works. Though I wouldn't mind being proved wrong on that :) Also, fundamentals are looking very bullish.  

I have no specific numbers in mind, but I think there's a good chance we dip some to consolidate and then blast through the top of the channel. I can't imagine we'll stay in the channel forever, and breaking downwards doesn't seem likely at this point, so up it is. I don't think that would be healthy, that's damn steep even on log scale.

It's just the beginning twinkling of the true potential that's coming. Exchanges are still shit. Most people still know nothing. Little or no professional money is involved.

If its value is in money transfer, there are other blockchains.

If its value is in its immutability, there are other blockchains.

If its value is in its privacy, there are other blockchains.

If its value is as a store of value, Litecoin or even Ethereum have been more stable than Bitcoin recently, and a blockchain with values pegged to a commodity would be a far better store of value.

My best guess is that its first mover status gives it all of its value, yet part of the value of a monetary system IS state control, unless you're into Austrian economics.

People are very interested in it and curious to learn about it and more importantly the attitude towards bitcoin is changing.

If I told friend or coworkers about bitcoin a year ago they immediately started talking about the dark web and criminals and how it was a scam and dangerous. The same people are now asking me for trading advice.  I teach a class at university and I noticed that in a class of 120 people about 6 of them were trading/checking the exchanges during class (and this wasn't a computer science class either).

And it's not only the young people, my husband works at a very conservative government agency and even his very conservative coworkers are talking about bitcoin. They even bought a bit of bitcoin together as an investment for the office party (its going to be a nice party this year).

They have a lot of good news going, and have remained stable through what could have / should have been significant hits -- BTC's big run didn't cause much of a fomo exit, Parity fuckups didn't do shit, BTC's correction didn't do shit, BTC's repeated run and BCash fuckery didn't do shit. It's been steady as a rock around $300 through good and bad. Every dip gets bought up, hard, and people actually hedged *into* Ether rather than pull out entirely when BTC was going down -- that basically never happened before. 

It's really very difficult to think the next big move for Ether would be anywhere but up from here -- it might still take longer to build up, but given how long and how *steadily* it consolidated around $300, it's hard to imagine a *correction* from here going downwards.

I thought this ride was done around $3k so I sold at $2800.  Never had experience with such a speculative investment so I fully liquidated.  I should have just sold off a portion.

Then I hesitated getting back in, ended up hesitating until $4k, got back in but diversified into ETH and scaled into it as it rose to $400 and got burned when it fell.

I also got burned by buying BTC like a day before the China FUD tanked it, then selling it, planning to rebuy the dip, but not paying attention on the day it bounced and finding myself at a higher price than I sold.  I also have some unbooked losses from altcoins.

All kinds of amateur mistakes, but I like to tell myself I've learned from them.  I was down about 20% from where I was at my peak.  Losses in five-figures.

Now, I'm treating my BTC as precious, and from buying some dips and benefiting from the continued rise my fiat value is about back to where it is.  But my BTC total is quite a bit lower.  So I'm going to build it back up with some 2x and 3x leveraged longs when I feel it's safe but always protect the bulk of my BTC.

ETH hasn't done jack since bitcoin was at ~$1.5k. It will double or triple in the next 6 months.... and it's probably a higher probability trade than expecting bitcoin to do the same. Perhaps I'm wrong, but that TA on ETH is solid. BTC is still in that long term channel. If it breaks that channel, I'd say the big winner will be BTC again, but as long as we're in the channel and ETH is drawing that triangle....

Exponential growth is exhibited when the rate of change—the change per instant or unit of time—of the value of a mathematical function is proportional to the function's current value, resulting in its value at any time being an exponential function of time, i.e., a function in which the time value is the exponent. Exponential decay occurs in the same way when the growth rate is negative. In the case of a discrete domain of definition with equal intervals, it is also called geometric growth or geometric decay, the function values forming a geometric progression. In either exponential growth or exponential decay, the ratio of the rate of change of the quantity to its current size remains constant over time.

That intermediary has to be a professional organization, on 24-hours a day, with high uptime, with gigantic amounts of money.

If that sounds like a credit card company, that's not a coincidence.

By contrast, the scenario that Blockstream usually talks about is a 5 points jump with three small-fry intermediaries to keep it 'decentralized,' but it came out recently that if any one of those is not honest or not online, the whole thing falls apart. 

Also, it will cost $100 to open and close a payment channel, so you'll want to minimize how many of these you're doing. The logical thing then is to pay a one-time fee to open a channel with a credit card analogue and use that for everything.

They claim they're trying to solve these structural problems to keep it decentralized, but the only solution is the one I gave originally, large centralized provider companies acting like banks or credit card companies and profiting on all transactions.

This isn't conspiracy, plenty of highly technical people have looked at the Lightning whitepaper and torn it apart as long on intentions and short on implementation details and have come to that same conclusion.

Lightning will also end up existing on BCH, but it will be completely optional, not forced on the entire ecosystem. And it will probably work better than the BTC one because it will remain cheap to open and close payment channels with anyone. That decentralized scenario they're talking about would be pretty close to viable on BCH, moreso than btc due to transaction fee cost.

But even without Lightning, other avenues of scaling are being explored, and non-lightning avenues of scaling to infinite TPS are in fact in the works. Bet you've never heard Blockstream talk about sharding, which would allow for unlimited scaling, *on chain*.

Despite this, an increase from 1MB to 2MB or even 8MB is still trivial at best.

As per the protocol design, that is incorrect.

That is the banker's restricted block size, anti-scaling model which is not compatible with the original vision:

It’s not a scaling solution and in my opinion segwit coins are fundamentally different from bitcoins. That’s why I will never put my money in a segwit address.

1) You agree to lock your bitcoins away for a certain time and lock can only be broken unless you and 3rd party agree to otherwise.  This is done by committed a scripted transaction to the blockchain.

2) To send money to 3rd party, you create a transaction with 3rd party with multisig that will allow third party to access a part of the funds and is only redeemable at a time slightly before the expiry of the transaction in step 1)  this transaction is not committed to blockchain but is instead stored on both users wallet.

3) You can keep doing transaction like in step 2 as many times as you want slightly decreasing the time until the transaction is valid.

4) If a certain party is not behaving properly, you can commit the transaction to the blockchain when the expiry time runs out .

5) All this should by handles seamlessly by the bitcoin wallet without you needed to ever understand how it works.

Take your blinders off. They're not going to do that. Even if they did increase it a bit that chain still has segwit and RBF, it still won't be good enough to compete with BCH. 

Now - the thing about users and the technical debt - Surely you and I will agree that the reason a majority of users are investing into BTC is profit yes?

In order for them to make profit, the value of the coin has to rise. 

In order for the value of the coin to rise organically, more on chain transactions have to be done, Metcalfe's Law and the velocity of money will ensure the price of the token in a closed system is pushed up.  

Therefore, limiting on chain throughput limits the potential value of a coin compared to just scaling on chain. 

So, users that hold segwit coins won't have the same opportunity to make profit since it is is real on-chain transaction throughput that causes the value of the coin to rise. With Segwit + L2, the value of the tokens can only rise as much as bankers allow it to, and I have news for you, they ain't interested in helping the average Joe get rich.

Assuming the premise that started this conversation is true, i.e. that Core will hardfork Bitcoin Segwit to something akin to Bitcoin Cash when they understand it as a threat, the quoted conclusion you made no longer applies, because then Bitcoin Segwit would have on chain scaling and users would happily ignore segwit.",1510846591.0,0,lcvella
dpwtykq,7d9myv,"You're not listening to me. 

It isn't about the block size. It's about segwit. Say they increase the block size to 2MB...well now engineers and developers have to plan to carry 6MB of bloated witness data. 

If they make block size 4MB, now they have to plan to carry an additional 12MB of bloated witness data. 

This data limits scaling by consuming bandwith, storage space, etc. But does not provide much additional throughput or revenue for miners. That is the problem.

Segwit is anti scaling because it ensures that **for any block size, planners must plan to carry an additional 3x that much as technical debt in the form of bloated witness data.**

Does that make sense? So any increase in on chain capacity at all, necessarily leads having to plan for the technical debt that comes with it. 


So say the bandwith of the world only allows for 100MB blocks due to whatever technical limitations. 

If we do 100MB of normal block space, it is 100MB of transaction data, giving us approx. 300 tx/s throughput. 

If we do 100MB blocks with segwit, then there are many different weight ratios that could happen, but we have to plan for the worst case scenario, which, according to the 1:3 limit, is 25MB of transaction data paired with 75MB of witness data. So in that situation we would be consuming the resources for 100MB blocks, but only getting 25MB of actual throughput. So in that case, in exchange for 100MB of resources consumed, we get only about 140 tx/s because of the way Segwit works. 

So segwit was never meant to help with scaling. I know they told us that, but it was really just about setting things up for L2. Segwit makes it **easier to do L2, but harder to scale on chain.**

##### **Mixing**

During the past days we just conducted our first successful mixes on the testnet. The software is experimental, mainnet is not supported.  

##### **Wallet Privacy Framework**

Half of the wallet privacy framework is already implemented into HiddenWallet. [See: ZeroLink Checklist](https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink#iv-zerolink-compliance-checklist).  


# Is there GUI?

Yes, there is a GUI:) [Here's me mixing with myself](https://twitter.com/nopara73/status/930210569730260992) on the testnet.

# Estimated Time of Arrival?  

At this point we are undecided if we'd like to release an unstable, experimental version or not. If we decide to do so, we'll do it within 2 months, otherwise it'll be around half a year.  
Since the Wallet Privacy Framework is not fully implemented yet, if decide to release within two months we'll not be able to provide perfect anonymity with ZeroLink.

They take issue with bitfinex allowing wash trades, but even if people are doing wash trades, they'd still be paying fees on those trades. So the income derived from trading fees would be the same regardless of whether or not wash trading was occurring, in fact it might even be higher due to that. 

He keeps saying that they have no banking, but any large trader as well as many businesses in the space that use them for liquidity (i would know as they're a competitor of mine in this regard) know that they do in fact have bank accounts. 

re Hawala banking: You honestly believe that bitfinex is disclosing very private information on their clients (their banking details) to other clients? If an exchange told me to wire funds to another client of theirs, thereby giving me that clients banking information, I would cut all business with them immediately as i'd be worried they do the same thing with my information. Furthermore, who your clients are is very private information, not something you'd exactly want to share. Otherwise what would keep a competitor from just farming information on who all of their clients are? 

I'm not saying that bitfinex doesn't need to release the audit they've been telling everyone they're going to do for a year, they absolutely do. I'm also not saying that what's happening with tether is all above board and in tip top shape, I don't know.

There are two sectors we're talking about.

1) The speculative market and trading, for this I'd say don't worry, Wall Street is expert at creating crashes themselves, it's how they profit. Compare to all the other bullshit Wall Street scams, the BTC market cap doesn't even come close to causing any real damage.

And they can't single out BCH for this, if they ban BCH, they have to ban all cryptocurrencies, which they won't because cryptocurrencies are obviously the future, everyone is jumping in.

If there is profit in it, Wall Street will keep milking it.

2) The actual economy, BTC is already broken to the point of being unusable due to the high fee and long confirmation time, so BTC crashing doesn't really change anything.

>Above question (edit: also) applies to Tether collapsing if you have an opinion on it.

For this I'd say if the bankers have a complete grip of the entire global economy, they would actually want to ban it, but the bankers are rapidly losing grounds on multiple fronts, they are not as united as they used to be, and they don't have that level of control anymore.

Bankers have much bigger fish to fry, so now they are just trying to break BTC to slow BTC down while they create their own replacement.

They'll eventually keep adding regulations to the trading and merchant side, but that process takes years/decades and you'll see it coming a mile away, plenty of time for you to make decisions.

dpw6vtx,7d9ae7,"Thanks for that, that's something I can respond to.

You make a good point that for something that's only valuable because its value is expected to go up, it is useless and will eventually crash. If that were the case with bitcoin you would have a point. But this isn't the case. The end goal for bitcoin is a currency that out-competes all the alternatives. This means that it has to be superior than banks (easy) and superior than VISA/paypal (hard). 

The problem is that on chain scaling simply won't out-compete VISA. 10 minute block times and requiring zero confirmations just won't do it. Why would a business accept the risk/uncertainty of a reversed/unconfirmed transaction when VISA has less risk? And if accepting zero confirmations became widespread, mechanisms to exploit this would become widespread as well. There's just no incentive for a business to move over when the status-quo works just fine.

On the flip side, there's no reason for a consumer to hold bitcoin if its not a store of value. Simply doing electronic transactions with blockchain can happen transparently through VISA or paypal. Or someone can simply purchase enough bitcoin for the transaction, transfer it, then have it sold on the other end. Such a state does not require a large market cap, and so will not have the effect on price that people hope for. For bitcoin to act as a currency (rather than a utility that, say, greases the wheels of international or trustless transfers), it needs to be a store of value such that people will hold bitcoin for its own sake, rather than simply buy it to accomplish some transaction then sell it. Divorcing the store of value aspect from the currency is fatal.

This is why the lightning network is so important to the future of bitcoin, and why a congested network in the short term has little consequence for the long term value proposition of bitcoin. The lightning network is what enables bitcoin to out-compete VISA. It give bitcoin all the benefits of VISA, while having irreversible transactions, no centralization, no cartel protection fee, etc. This makes it attractive to businesses. The fact that bitcoin is a value store is what makes it attractive to consumers. This creates the right incentives on both sides of the transaction for its use as a currency. You might say ""but if its a store of value no one will spend it"". Eventually it reaches an equilibrium where the value of holding a unit of bitcoin is equal to the value of easily transacting with it (e.g. you're paid in bitcoin so better to use it than something else). Then you suddenly have a viable currency. This is the future we all hope for.",1510806476.0,1,hackinthebochs
dpw7x76,7d9ae7,"**[SegWit Creates Incentives to Form Mining Cartels](https://nchain.com/en/blog/risks-of-segregated-witness-mining-cartels/) - June 18th, 2017**

***

If implemented, SegWit would change this for the worse.  It opens the door to an economic incentive model that would encourage mining cartels to form. As the bitcoin network currently operates, there is no incentive for miners to form cartels. Mining pools are not cartels; they are a firm. But SegWit introduces a fundamental change to bitcoin:  the “AnyOneCanSpend address”, or essentially a blank signature for transactions.   SegWit uses an “AnyOneCanSpend” address so that transactions will be validated and recorded into blocks, even though the sender/receiver signature data is separated.   Normally, an “AnyOneCanSpend” output (as its name implies) would allow any miner to spend the funds associated with that transaction; therefore, SegWit would introduce new rules for interpreting “AnyOneCanSpend”. This means that miners could not take advantage of that output address to inappropriately spend the funds associated with all SegWit transactions.

***

**But with “AnyOneCanSpend” addressing, the system is only secure while all participants agree it is secure.  Proponents of SegWit assume that once its protocol change is activated, all miners will agree to play nicely, never steal funds, and funds will be locked up safely.   But the major flaw in their thinking is that it ignores economic incentives for nefarious miners to do the following after SegWit activates:**

* Form a cartel to take over the network
* Switch off SegWit and revert back to the current bitcoin protocol
* Take advantage of the “AnyoneCanSpend” address to instantly steal funds associated with all SegWit transactions in blocks they mined.

***

**By using “AnyOneCanSpend” addressing, SegWit therefore opens the door to a corrupt miner mining a block to subvert transactions, and instead redirect them to the miner’s own address.  The value of such an illicit attack would grow every day SegWit is used.  Over time, the more people use bitcoin, the more SegWit transactions are added to the blockchain, and the more funds are locked up with SegWit aspects of bitcoin, the more valuable this form of cartel attack becomes.  A defecting miner could access historical funds that have not been redirected from SegWit to a traditional bitcoin address. Hence, the longer a SegWit system runs, the more likely it is that a cartel will form to steal funds.**

***

Even in 2015, the same thing was mentioned about SegWit.

> (Note that it is important that all miners – or a very large majority – should use Segregated Witness in order to prevent double spends and chain forks, or none of them should. If all miners do use Segregated Witness, old nodes on the network might wonder why some transactions aren't included in blocks, but since it was always up to miners to decide which transactions to include, and since these are not their transactions, they won't mind, either.)
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/segregated-witness-part-how-a-clever-hack-could-significantly-increase-bitcoin-s-potential-1450553618/

Therefore, that is the problem. They don't have to use it. And they don't have to not use it. And when 100% of miners use it. The first 51% of miners who collude together, can simply stop using it, while everyone else is happily following orders ""to stay on SegWit no matter what"", while the 51% are doing double spend transactions behind their back without anybody even knowing. Addresses that people were comfortable with ""never looking at again until old age"" automatically have zero coins because they got sent somewhere. Miners in this situation would be covertly robbing people, while pretending/signalling that they are 100% mining SegWit.",1510807893.0,1,MartinGandhiKennedy

Of course we most definitely should not blindly follow authority. It's just the combination of all of this information combined with what the original developers have said, is much more than compelling. Is much more than ""belief"". It's verification of scientific method. That you have verified, after someone else had verified, after someone else had verified.

dpwb31o,7d9ae7,"This is an interesting analysis, but I'm not sure how sound it is. For example, one cannot attack the network in such a way and then expect the network to still be valuable. Once you change transactions in your favor, you've essentially eliminated any faith in bitcoin and its value will very quickly drop to zero. So the question is would someone be able to cash out fast enough before information of the attack spread? I doubt it. So one can attack bitcoin at the expense of bitcoin. The only reliable profit here seems to be in shorting bitcoin's collapse.

The other issue is that it seems odd that a mining cartel could essentially force other nodes to accept blocks that they know are invalid. It seems to me that any protocol deviation should result in a network fork, where the attackers are creating their own dishonest chain and the honest users have their own chain. While its true that the attacking chain has more hashpower, it seems irrelevant. I don't see why any node would go with the higher hashrate over its own ability to judge the validity of a block. I don't know enough details of how bitcoin actually handles cases like this, so I can't say what clients will *actually* do. But it seems clear a 51% attack should be useless simply because it causes a fork. It seems that the only danger is for thin clients that don't do their own verification and simply rely on the ""longer chain is the right chain"" heuristic.

This is a problem with conflating terms in bitcoin as more normal people join. That may be an English definition of ""consensus"", but the original usage of the term in this space is the computer science sense of the word: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)

""Consensus"" is a term used in distributed computing, to determine the network ""state"" as in ""steady state"" or ""transient state"" or what ""state"" H2O is in at any particular temp/pressure. Every 10 minutes, thousands of computers come to *consensus* about the ""state"" of all balances for all public keys. Somewhere along the lines, people decided to use it to describe the state of public opinion as well, which is why there's so much confusion about ""what is the real bitcoin"" now. The answer to that question lies right within your own node... ""Bitcoin"" is whatever the network state is, according to blocks that come in and conform to your consensus rules. There's as many different ""bitcoins"" as there are different chains following different consensus rules. ",1510840663.0,1,Auwardamn

dpwo2km,7d97s5,"**Consensus (computer science)**

A fundamental problem in distributed computing and multi-agent systems is to achieve overall system reliability in the presence of a number of faulty processes. This often requires processes to agree on some data value that is needed during computation. Examples of applications of consensus include whether to commit a transaction to a database, agreeing on the identity of a leader, state machine replication, and atomic broadcasts. The real world applications include clock synchronization, PageRank, opinion formation, smart power grids, state estimation, control of UAVs, load balancing and others.

Luke says the system with 100 users is more decentralized and secure.  Its all about semantics.  Decentralization can have a wide range of definitions and it exists on a spectrum and has many facets to it.  The end goal is censorship resistance and security.  We gain this by attracting more users and spreading globally.  Even though nodes get more expensive there will be more of them in existence.  Also don't underestimate Moore's Law and human innovation.  A money system even enhances incentives for innovation further.  Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of Bitcoin also says [its silly for every user to run a node](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306):

> The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

Its segwit that leads to centralization and control by strangling the blocksize and forcing everyone onto 2nd layer systems like LN, which are known to consolidate into centralized entities that will succumb to KYC/AML regulations.  Then segwitcoin needs permission.  Bitcoin Cash will remain permissionless as it follows Satoshi's original design.",1510799210.0,18,cryptorebel

the reason is that bitcoin is an ubiquitous asset.

* stock, if you see bitcoin as a platform
* bond, this will eventually happen after volatility is gone
* commodity, it is scarce
* real estate, most real estate is owned for speculation or inflation protection

and now the important part which will prevent the crash.

* cash

the rising price will make bitcoin a feasible tool to settle international trades. the more the price rise the more business types can use the platform. right now small and med cap companies should be able to use bitcoin for international settlements, but with a rising price this opportunity will be available for large cap companies, banks and finaly for central banks. this usecase is completely decoupled from speculation and will prevent a massive crash like it would be possible for a pure speculative asset.

Bitcoin is a commodity/currency that derives its value from scarcity and drawing upon the faith of those who own it that the coin is valuable. In a major crash that is a result of the unwinding of levered long positions, it is feasible that the public loses faith in BTC and never recovers the value lost.

When futures rises before spot, arbitrageurs will short futures and long the spot to bring them together again. Otherwise the rise in futures cannot sustain. For equity, it's easy to long the spot with leverage; but for BTC, so far it's not easy to borrow and buy the ""coin"", at least not at institutional level. So my guess is that, for BTC, the rise in its futures market will be slower, as it's easier to short the futures than long BTC with leverage, and we may not experience that madness in 1987.

Also, it's very important to point out: bitcoin is most certainly not a company stock. Even when bitcoin is commodified into the futures market, it's still a different entity than the usual stuff traded on the NYSE: how it will react to this new kind of speculation will be subject to the usual nonsense of human psychology, but bitcoin has consistently shown a push towards greater value, even in the midst of chaos surrounding the currency.

> This sell will start and accelerate, hitting stop losses and margin calls, which is “mechanical selling”. The mechanical selling (forced selling) will cascade and create a feedback loop where more margin calls are hit, more stop losses, etc etc

Many exchanges don't push forced liquidations into the order book for precisely this reason.  Some exchanges will take the other side of the trade and then manually trade it.

The GDAX ethereum flash crash is the only instance I'm aware of where an exchange (which had just added leverage positions) cause a forced-liquidation cascade.

dpwnii9,7d964e,"The halvening has much more of an effect when speculation and confidence is low. At that time, most buy and sell orders are based on transactions for goods and services. Buyers buying bitcoins to be able to pay someone else. That someone else selling those bitcoins after the trade has taken place. For the price to be stable, the influx of new money must match the selling pressure from miners, which is their cost of operation. In that case, if the market hasn't already factored it into the price (which they haven't on the previous two halvenings), then the supply diminishes while the demand doesn't. This in turn should steadily push the price upwards, until a new equilibrium is found. Unless, once again, the market doesn't anticipate this, and corrects upwards ahead of time. Which has actually happened, there is a lot of psychology involved.

When confidence is high, on the other hand, then speculation is more prevalent, early adopters liquidate more of their holdings, and trading volume is higher. This all means that mining rewards being dumped to the market, accounts for a much smaller portion of the total sell pressure. This should, theoretically, mean that the halvening should have a much smaller, immediate effect on price, even if the long term effect stays the same.

That said, I believe that gold was not easily manipulable until post Bretton Woods in 1971. A true store of value where it is in high demand for this use, will eventually cause great losses to the manipulators. They may succeed short term (BCH Roger Ver Jihan etc are a good example of this), but get whipsawed long term because the fundamental trend is deflationary.

Once Nixon took the US off the gold standard, the store of value feature of gold was impaired. It's value became purely psychological and could therefore be manipulated by price swings.

At the height of the real estate market in the US, I had committed to building a big house.  I had no choice then.

Timing the market is damn near impossible.  But if I had not made that fortuitous decision when I did, I would have had a huge amount cash (dry powder) to wield.  I could have bought three times the property I did.  

And the smart money waited a few years and that's EXACTLY what happened.  Everyone foreclosed.  The banks were inundated with {real estate owned} properties.  They are banks, not property managers.  Smart money bought that shit for pennies, sort of.  

I just pulled the trigger a year too early.  I couldn't double down in a bad market.

Say X went long on bitcoin by +$200 and his futures contract is coming due, but the price is static.

Should he just pay the losses, or will he buy enough bitcoin to raise the price by $200 so he can break even on the contract and still theoretically sell bitcoin at that price attaining a zero-loss.

Alternately, anyone who wants to try this same strategy on the short side must *already have bitcoin to sell*, which is actually harder than buying.

So say they short -$200 on the price but the price is static and their contract is coming due. 

So they sell enough bitcoin to bring the price down $200 and offset the expected loss.

These numbers are obviously really inflated from a realistic scenario, and there are all sorts of ways to counter-game people trying these things that tend to cancel out. 

If you see the order book has a gigantic amount of shorts coming due soon, you realize there may be selling pressure and so you setup a large amount of stop orders under the current price to soak up anyone trying to flood the market with cheap bitcoin.

And on the other side, if they try to buy tons of bitcoin, you can setup large limit orders that soak-up their funds without significantly raising the price.

It becomes a huge game of who has more assets and can bully the other guy. The whales throw their weight around and can often win that way, but sometimes they get epically burned, like the legend of Bearwhale back in 2013/2014.

The overall effect of all these people trying to game each other is a reduction in volatility and an increase in liquidity, both good effects.

That's the theory anyway. Bitcoin is still a pretty small market and we might see a couple more years of volatility until things settle down as the land-rush into bitcoin investment creates interesting effects.",1510817443.0,3,Anenome5

It has happened so often now that I scoff at the gloom and doom reporting because it has gone on now for three or four years longer than it should, in each case.  

In some cases, the media is still running with that old recession story after the economic cycle has run its course again.  During the Bush W. administration that happened.  

People were so in shock from the tech bubble that a whole recovery happened and left that they never noticed the recovery.  Mid 2000's.  Of course on the back side of that, derivatives and housing bubble.

Just because a lot of people have jobs, doesn't mean they've recovered.  If you're over 40 and one of the recessions wiped out your house and savings, you've got a lot to work to do before you can come close to retiring. It is especially difficult for many (self-employed, small business) with no certainties whatsoever with health insurance. Some people are working that much because they need to save $15,000 just to have a baby, let alone prepare for an unexpected catastrophic injury like a car accident.

I've lived in a couple of places that were some of the hardest hit in 2006, so perhaps my experience is a bit skewed, but there are very large markets where a lot of people were entirely wiped out. For example, in my neighborhood in 2007-8, 1/3 of the houses were vacant, 1/3 were for sale and the last third was mostly retirees who had paid off their house but could not leave it if they wanted to. These people may all have jobs now, but when 20 years of savings is wiped out in 2 years, it takes a toll.

For those who are young and have said that they are going to cash out at certain milestones, I suggest you do your best to continue to invest. It's Bitcoin is still surging, keep as much in as you can and if it fails move on to the next crypto or the best investment you can find.  When I see milestones like a vacation or $100,000, I don't consider those significant enough to warrant selling off investments for h you can do better and opportunities like Bitcoin don't come around often, so keep the money in play until it's something you can retire with. Anyone under 30 in good health can expect to live to 100 these days and if you plan to retire at 65 or 70, you're going to need well over a million before you even think about taking money out.

I'm not saying don't have fun or don't take vacations. I'm just saying we are riding a money train like you probably will never see again and if taking a vacation wipes out your Bitcoin Holdings, you will be regretting it, so keep some in play. In the past 12 months, Bitcoin has returned over **1000%**, however, in the ""normal"" world of investing, you should be satisfied with an ***8% annual return***.

Get a new car and drive it to work?  You will inevitably hear, ""Must be nice to have enough money to afford a car like that!""

That thinking is insidious unless you are strong enough to deflect it.

Don't be one of the jealous crabs in the bucket who tries to deny the other crab a shot at their freedom.  Give them a pat on the back and say  ""Good for you and your progress"".

Man, so much wisdom in that. This whole thread, actually. 

I have been hodling (sic...hahaha) back from commenting because I could spend my whole day doing so on this thread, but this, apparently, is the one that got me to comment.

Re: the crabs:

yep. I was lucky enough to get messages from (god, the Universe, whatever you wanna call it) that I had to get out of the  bucket I was in. In the situation I was in there, I could not get enough alone time to regroup and process to be sure I was right that these other crabs were in fact pulling me down (because they almost invariably told me that they were actually trying to boost me up...ain't that nice of them?)

Add to that that each crab doing it to (me, in this case) is like the old ""boiling a frog"" metaphor. 

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog) 

 People who pull ya down like that are very crafty about it, (consciously or otherwise). They start off nice(r), and slowly, and strategically turn up the heat (again, consciously or otherwise), until one day, you (hopefully) figure out that you are in a boiling pot of water that they are putting the flame to.

That said, if anyone reading this feels like they are a crab in a bucket/frog in a pot of water (I know, I know, mixed metaphors),**know** that there are places where there are less people trying to boil frogs in the world...or at least, places where you will figure out their game a lot quicker because it's a different culture.

dpwjshn,7d964e,"Like I said, it is possible we are in different areas and different experiences.  The real estate crash was very geographic-dependent.  People in Florida were hit much worse than people in Maine, for example.  I lived in one of the hardest hit markets in the Southwest and had just bought my ""starter"" home in 2004, expecting to be in it for just a few years because I under-bought and was hoping to catch some equity and move on. House was bought for about $320,000 and when I saw what my neighborhood looked like 18 months later and my mortgage lender was one of the major bailout recipient and also refusing to work with any homeowners (because the gov't assumed they would trickle it down to us, I don't know), I knew I had to get out. 

The bank (Wells Fargo) was essentially keeping the bailout $billions *and* all of the profit under the original loan contract, expecting me to take all of the loss for a problem that they created.  It was insane. I lost all respect for institutions when I saw what they were doing. So I decided to do a strategic default and stopped paying them.  When they moved to foreclose, they had to go through a mediation process in my state and they screwed that up, so I sued them and was able to walk away with a short sale, but my house sold for only $92,500!  That is a huge loss in 18 months. Not many people were able to get out as easy as I did (which I don't consider very easy because it cost me a lot). And, it destroyed a once nice neighborhood - turned it into a ghost town when the value was sucked out.

dpwtnsw,7d964e,"**Boiling frog**

The boiling frog is a parable describing a frog being slowly boiled alive. The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.

While some 19th-century experiments suggested that the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out.

But, their share of blame is not even close to that of the banks - they lent what they shouldn't, hid that fact and sold the responsibility off to investors who were relying on representations that weren't true. Did you see my other reply where I went through some of my numbers?

It was the banks that did the lending. They had the responsibility to evaluate their borrowers and decide if they had the ability to meet the loan terms.  Instead of lending to qualified people, they lent to anyone.  Do you know what a NINJA loan is? Ridiculous.  Instead of laying in the bed they made with these stupid loans, they sold them off to investors, misrepresenting the quality of the loans that they negotiated.  And, you can't argue that the banks didn't know - do you remember the Savings & Loan crisis of the late 1980s when a ton of credit unions went under?  They tanbked because they did the exact same thing - all the people running the banks had watched this happen earlier in the careers and went ahead and did the exact same thing.

I know people like to blame the government as well and much of that is fair since congress encouraged mortgage lending and ""inspired"" the market, but the people who were supposed to know what they were doing saw the $$$ and short-term benefit and ignored fundamentals.  I also agree that congress is partially to blame because they also dealt with the S&L fallout and threw caution to the wind by deregulating.

Priority one is, as he says, that everyone be able to use Bitcoin. That means you can't do 2 at the expense of 1 and you can't do 2 until you've achieved 1. Core have it the wrong way round.

What Core calls ""nodes"" are technically parasites on the network, though a necessary tool for some businesses. Bitcoin is only as decentralized as its mining.

Miners are. **Mining nodes are the only validating nodes worthy of the name!** 

Core hates the idea that the Bitcoin network is a mining network, because their understanding of economics and incentives is so amateur that they think this opens Bitcoin to abuse by miners. Miners *always* have the *power* to abuse the network (and ""validating nodes"" are of no help against the most damaging attack) but they have every *incentive* not to. Incentives are apparently a subtle concept, but they are what makes Bitcoin work. If you already don't believe the incentive structure works, these comically mislabeled ""validating nodes"" can't save you, and if you do believe the incentive structure works they are mostly pointless for the average person to run and are largely useless for decentralization, the whole point of which is after all to make it unviable to attack Bitcoin.

To understand why Bitcoin is P2P without peers running these silly ""validating nodes,"" read section 8 of the whitepaper (carefully) and also read the final section ""Do We Need Fraud Proofs?"" here:

> You yourself have admitted that this will eventually be a problem:

No, I answered my question with a ""maybe."" I'm actually pretty skeptical that it will ever be necessary to impose a ""consensus rule""- style ""block size limit"" that functions as a binding economic constraint because I believe that the natural limits on block size will be sufficient.

> so going on that logic you're admitting that eventually we will need alternate solutions to block-size scaling.

No, I really haven't. I've repeatedly argued that there are no ""alternate solutions.""  Borrowing from a previous comment of mine:

So-called ""layer two solutions"" aren't ""scaling""; they're *banking*. The fundamental problem is that when you move transactions onto a ""second layer,"" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained. The smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it. (Consider, for example, [the LN's ""fractional-teller banking"" problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4rdkiy/heres_how_bitcoins_lightning_network_could_fail/d50akqm/)) There's nothing inherently *wrong* with ""layers."" There will always be a natural balance between money proper (on-chain transactions) and various money substitutes (things like the proposed LN or even just simple fully-custodial banking models). The problem with an arbitrary limit on the transactability of the money proper is that it distorts this balance.

>The idea that we should ""just do what we can today, so that maybe things will work out tomorrow"" is how the United States got in trouble with military spending, social security, debt buying/selling, college loans, federal reserve inflation... etc... and is exactly the reason that people are losing faith in governments.

I don't really see how that applies.  My basic point is pretty simple.  Transactional friction is cancer for money or anything that aspires to become money because literally the entire purpose of money is to *reduce* transactional friction.

dpx30r3,7d94is,"BCH has undergone 2 forks in less than 6months and has created two new currencies in the process (BCH and BClashic)

The latest hardfork was done without really any time for the network to upgrade. A major fork like this should have been included in clients several releases in advance of activation; to help ensure the network doesn't bifurcate. The only way that the network could have upgraded in time is if it was highly centralized.

So either BCH is highly centralized and proved this by undergoing a hardfork without contention (you always have consensus when there is no real community to appeal to) ; or the BCH/BClashic fork was rushed ; in which case it created another rift in the community.

There are plenty of people that believe that the DAA ""upgrade"" was rushed and did not have enough testing. 

There is now real risk that not all nodes and services upgraded; and now that BClashic is being mined; it is possible that it gains enough hashpower to overtake total work performed and Blockheight; and just completely wipe out all the transactions on the BCH chain since the split.

BCH is actually one of the MOST mutable chains in existence. It shares absolutely none of the properties that currently give Bitcoin value; and it doesn't have anywhere near the Tx capacity and privacy of other chains.

BCH is a complete scam coin.",1510856191.0,1,45sbvad
dpwqz3n,7d94is,"Exactly; BCH in particular is vulnerable to chain reorganization because it has a small minority of BTC hashrate. 

It only takes a few percent of the BTC hashrate to threaten a chain reorganization on BCH.

For instance; the DAA hardfork that took place on Nov 13th created a permanent chain split of BCH and BCH Classic (with the EDA).

The EDA once active will drastically reduce the difficulty on the BCH Classic Chain and eventually become ""profitable"" for miners to mine. In the same way the BCH overtook BTC's blockheight; BCH Classic will overtake BCH blockheight; but because the ecosystem has not had time to fully upgrade it is quite possible that BCH Classic overwrites the BCH chain transaction history.

There is a reason that major ""upgrades"" need to be included several releases in advance before activating. This gives the ecosystem time to update their nodes and services to protect against such an attack.

BCH has no competitive advantage. It is not concerned about protecting ""immutability"" nor does it have the fastest, least expensive, and/or most private transactions. It is a 3month old network that is accepted basically nowhere. There is no infrastructure for BCH. It is highly centralized at every level; miners, nodes, ownership.

In addition to that; its price is artificially inflated because only ""active"" Bitcoiners and traders even know about the BCH airdrop. There are plenty of people that have no intention of holding their BCH other than the fact that they went through a lot of trouble setting up cold-storage methods that they don't want to compromise for a 15% gain.

BCH is only relevant at all because it attempts to take advantage of Bitcoin name recognition and network effect through an airdrop. Many coins have tried this before (I think I still have some CLAMS).

If BCH were launched as its own coin today it would not gain any adoption on its own merits. Bitcoin is more stable and secure; and many other options for fast cheap transactions.

dpwo2jp,7d94is,"Ok. Lets start at ground zero. Today. 4 transactions per second.

Moores law states that to keep the same level of node operation as we have today then the blocksize should double every 2 years (50% per year as you put it).

In 14 years from now that gives you 512 transactions per second.

So you are assuming this will be enough, In a decade and a half from now.

If in 14 years from now you have say 1 billion users, thats enough capacity to give every user one transaction every 22.6 days before your blocks clog up. Say you want all 1 billion future users to have 1 transaction per day? Ok, so then start now at 128 transactions per second (around 32mb blocks) and double that every 2 years for 14 years and each of your future users can have 1 transaction per day. 

Maybe you might want each future user to have 10 transactions per day? Ok start today at 1280 transactions per second (lets say 512 mb blocks) and double that every 2 years for 14 years.

If you want to have 1 billion users in 14 years from now each allowed 10 transactions per day. Then you have to be willing to have 512mb blocks TODAY and double that every 2 years for the next 14 years along with moores law. If you cant have 512mb blocks TODAY then you cant even have 10 transactions per user per day in 14 years from now.

But thats just dreaming. A network that only allows 10 transactions per user per day is useless. In 14 years each user will be streaming money, each smart device will be streaming money, im guessing each user will need atleast the capacity for 1 transaction per minute plus lets say theres an extra 1 billion smart devices as users. So at a MINIMUM, 2 billion users each requiring 1140 transactions per day. Thats 26,388,888 transactions per second (26 million transactions per second).To get to that point following moores law means you need to start TODAY with 206,163 transactions per second (close enough to 64GB blocks).

So, if you cannot handle 64 GIGABYTE blocks TODAY and then continue to double that every 2 years folowing moores law, you will never be able to handle anywhere near enough transaction traffic in the future.

If the start is now and the goal is 14 years from now and you try to keep up with this level of growth, im guessing within the next 3 to 5 years your blockchain will be controlled by a conglomorate of a few global miners (most likely government agencies) who have ALL the power, can censor any transactions they want and alter the protocol in any way they want. And you definitely wont be able to run a node to independently validate your own transaction.

The ONLY way to scale safely is using smart contracts and keeping the blocksize as small as possible for as long as possible.

Its sad that because out of short term frustration you are willing to destroy the long term viability of bitcoin to deliver its promise of independent self-soverign money.

I completely agree with this, however I'd argue that while traditional banking is governed by shitty people,  this type of risk is managed by non-biased code. Though I am certainly not arguing that this type of thing comes without consequences, certainly the one you mentioned.

I'm not sure I follow. *I don't know* if we'll eventually ""hit a wall.""  To me, any such wall is likely so far ahead that the question today is pretty much academic. But it doesn't really matter to my argument which is simply that we can't arbitrarily limit block size. If the real technological capacity wall is way up ahead at 1-GB and we continue to hold in place an artificial wall at 1-MB, that opens the door to Bitcoin being outcompeted by an alternative that doesn't self-limit itself to such an extreme an unnecessary degree.

>I completely agree with this, however I'd argue that while traditional banking is governed by shitty people, this type of risk is managed by non-biased code.

Ok, but  shitty people don't go away. It's true that your ""bank"" (""hub"") in a LN scenario doesn't have complete custodial control over your money as would be the case in traditional banking, but the potential opportunity for them to defraud you still exists. 

>The hinge on my argument is that transactional friction is on a lower tier of concern than the fidelity of your network.

Ok, but absolute comparisons like that are meaningless.  So you want to claim that fidelity is ""more important"" than transactional friction? Well, what does that imply? That we should *reduce* the block size limit further? Maybe down to 1kb? Because that would obviously render the network completely unusable (thereby massively undermining its ""fidelity"").  Does it imply that we should keep the 1-MB limit in place forever? Because that would obviously eventually have the same effect.  The question is one of *tradeoffs*.  And that's why IF a limit is needed, it can't be set arbitrarily or inflexibly.  The goal instead should be to set it at the point where the marginal benefits of allowing larger blocks begin to be outweighed by the marginal costs, which (again, IF a limit is even needed) is going to be a moving target (and, one would assume, a target that moves *upward* over time as technology improves).

>I agree both chains have their issues, but it just seems to be like BCH has backed themselves into a corner for their long term solution, while BTC is still attempting to innovate and find one.

Well, again, I don't think there is any real ""long term solution"" that can magically avoid the need to allow scaling of the blockchain proper.  And I don't think BCH has backed itself into a corner. For that matter, I don't *really* think BTC has either. Both chains are really just their ledgers.

In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years. The period is often quoted as 18 months because of Intel executive David House, who predicted that chip performance would double every 18 months (being a combination of the effect of more transistors and the transistors being faster).

No, I'm arguing that a LN ""payment"" that takes the form of updating the state of an open channel (which obviously occurs off-chain) is an imperfect substitute for a payment that takes the form of an actual, confirmed, on-chain transaction.  How can you get defrauded in the latter case? If the person paying you manages to pull off a double spend. The good news is changing the public history of transactions in such a manner  ""quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker... if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power."" How can you get defrauded in the former case? Well, the nature of the LN is such that if one party closes a channel in an old state in an attempt to steal from you, you must act to block the attempted theft by getting your own breach remedy transaction added to the blockchain within a defined ""dispute period."" That is a fundamentally different (and weaker) security model. It depends on a user's supposed ability to, when needed, get an on-chain transaction confirmed on the blockchain in a timely manner which is of course exactly what's compromised by imposing an arbitrary constraint on on-chain capacity.

But an even simpler way to see why the LN isn't some magical free lunch that eliminates the need for actual (i.e., on-chain) scaling is to consider some basic math.

Certainly I've seen *some* people say that. (Have you really not seen anyone suggest that Bitcoin base protocol should be ""immutable""?)

Because I'd say we already waved bye-bye to that point. And ""conservative""? This bizarre insistence on clinging to a crude, arbitrary, and always-intended-to-be-temporary limit long after it's become inadequate, while Bitcoin hemorrhages use cases and users to competitors as the network becomes increasingly and absurdly unusable -- that's not conservatism, that is recklessness.

No one here, not even Ver and Jihan are saying anyone should be prohibited from running a node.  This is pure Blockstream propaganda.  Quite to the contrary, Ver has argued that anyone and everyone who wants to run a node can have at it.  If the bandwidth becomes cost prohibitive, Ver has suggested, on many occasions, that groups can run a node on purchased bandwidth and share the cost.  It is conceivable that you have 100's of node clubs wherein everyone chips in a buck a month and the node keeps a watchful eye.

As for Nakamoto's original vision of nodes; it is much closer to Ver/Jihan's vision than Back and/or other core devs/small-blockers.

*""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification 
(section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.*  ***Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.***  *A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.*

*""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.

Then they can do another EDA and mine at low difficulty until the next retarget, and so on.

However, when they reach the Nov 13 time, their chain will continue to use the old rules unless they implement another HF on their chain to make it compatible with current Bitcoin Cash rules.

Otherwise, they will diverge from current Cash chain at the Nov 13 fork point, and their chain will in no way be a threat to Cash.

Their chain can still turbo-block to overtake the height of the main Cash chain, but the amount of work they put in will be less than main chain anyway. So even if they HF to the new DAA-compatible rules from some block onwards, they would need a massive amount of superior hashpower to make up for their turbo-block phase which would probably have been done at much lower hashrate.

And then they would need to 'catch up and overtake' to the chain work done on main chain in a legitimate way.

/u/Erumara is probably right  that the likelihood of this happening is zero.

That's unless we are overlooking something.

Due to the lack of replay protection on this 'Clashic', someone who spends only pre-Aug-1 inputs could get their transaction replayed onto the 'Clashic' chain.

The Clashic folks might want to somehow stir up drama about this unavoidable situation, but it only illustrates that their fork didn't take the necessary safety precautions which Bitcoin Cash did when it forked.

This is in fact perhaps the only error Satoshi made in the Bitcoin white paper.  It's the only one I've ever been able to find anyway. Satoshi also mistakenly assumed that the longest chain would be the valid one and IIRC the original client he built followed the longest chain. The error was discovered very early on.

If ""longest chain is valid"" were true, Bitcoin Cash would already have the title ""Bitcoin"" because it has produced more blocks than the legacy BTC chain. 

In fact Bitcoin Cash is a perfect example of why we don't use chain length but instead use most proof of work: anyone can build a fork that spits out blocks willy-nilly. What makes them the most valid chain is the work put into them not how many blocks they spit out.

A lot of people myself included often use ""longest chain"" to mean ""heaviest chain"" which is the better term so it's easy to get confused. It's always better to refer to it as the ""heaviest chain.""",1510841040.0,1,jessquit

But there are a bunch of cryptocurrencies that are better than bitcoin for micro transactions that have been around for a long time.  Like VTC.  It’s been around for years and it’s just barely getting off the ground.  But people don’t hear about Vertcoin on the news.  They hear about bitcoin.  Every newspaper and news channel brings it up here and there but they rarely mention anything else.  People with huge pockets want something that has been around for years and has a store of value.  They want the cryptocurrency that they hear has had insane gains in the past year.  They want easy.  It’s hard for these investors to research something that’s hard to understand and then open up accounts on multiple exchanges, to buy a coin, to buy another coin, to get something that makes sense, then figure out how to store it in a safe place.  It needs to be easier if we want to bring rich douche bags in.

The good news is, if Bitcoin doesn’t figure out how to scale cheaply soon, more and more exchanges are going to accept coins like bitcoin Cash and once mass adoption happens, large numbers of smart people will start putting their money in other vehicles.

Regarding cryptocurrencies I think it’s safe to assume that ending net neutrality could lead to more centralization in mining as it will discourage solo mining by slowing down the downloading of blocks. The case for larger block sizes would also be weakened for the same reason.

If you believe that crypto (ethereum?) could lead to the Internet 3.0, then ending net neutrality could validate the need for a decentralized internet and accelerate its adoption.

keep track of who has what. 

The genius of crypto is simply challenging the notion that there needs to be an agreed upon intermediary to keep ledgers and broker transactions. Maybe we don’t ‘agree’ the incumbents are doing the job anymore. 
Self interested anonymous peers can do the same, and shared ledgers allow direct exchange. 

Now when no central authority has the ability to influence the value of the token (ie influencing inflation) we end up with strange effects. For Rai stones, high inflation (the stones got bigger to represent the same value). For bitcoin, rampant deflation. You can buy more stuff (pizza, coffee, dollars) with each coin almost daily. 

Both conditions are bad news for a functioning economy. With regard to bitcoin we still have many other channels for exchange of value, so it’s not killing spending in the economy etc. But it has become a ‘store of value’ or perhaps a speculative commodity, rather than a true medium of exchange.  

I believe Satoshi designed the increasing mining difficulty and ultimately limited supply of coins to control inflation without putting monetary policy decision authority in a central power. 

However without the ability to moderate wild increase in purchasing power (or rather willingness- would piss a lot of newly rich people off to swing btc to a ~2% inflation rate) the dream of bitcoin is under threat of going extinct just like the rai stones.

",1510837575.0,1,pecuniology
dpw70si,7d8syg,"Yeah, I had the same reaction.  From the wikipedia entry:

>The physical location of the stone may not matter—though the ownership of a particular stone changes, the stone itself is rarely moved due to its weight and risk of damage. The names of previous owners are passed down to the new one. In one instance, a large rai being transported by canoe and outrigger was accidentally dropped and sank to the sea floor. Although it was never seen again, everyone agreed that the rai must still be there, so it continued to be transacted as genuine currency.[6] What is important is that ownership of the rai is clear to everyone, not that the rai is physically transferred or even physically accessible to either party in the transfer.

So in essence, what you might assume to have been the base layer (physical transfer of the stones) was *so* horrifically inefficient that it essentially didn't exist and wasn't the real money proper.  Thus, the shared memory / oral history that kept tabs of ownership wasn't really a ""layer 2"" -- it was effectively the real monetary base.

Rai, or stone money (Yapese: raay), are large, circular stone disks carved out of limestone formed from aragonite and calcite crystals. Rai stones were quarried on several of the Micronesian islands, mainly Palau, but briefly on Guam as well, and transported for use as money to the island of Yap. They have been used in trade by the Yapese as a form of currency. The monetary system of Yap relies on an oral history of ownership.

WikiTribune (stylized as WikiTRIBUNE) is a planned news website in which professional journalists research and report news stories alongside volunteers who curate articles by proofreading, fact-checking, suggesting changes and adding sources. Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, announced the site in April 2017 as a for-profit site, not affiliated with Wikipedia or its support organisation, the Wikimedia Foundation.

""This will be the first time that professional journalists and citizen journalists will work side-by-side as equals writing stories as they happen, editing them live as they develop and at all times backed by a community checking and rechecking all facts"", said Wales. Wales intends for the project to help fight fake news online; he was reportedly motivated to address this problem after hearing the Counselor to the U.S. president, Kellyanne Conway, use the expression ""alternative facts"" during an interview in January 2017.

This page constitutes my design specification for a semantic technology, a user-generated content management technology, that best solves the content monetisation problem. For Wikipedia, the objective is to reward from within, instead of allowing payment from outside.

I call this semantic technology the real Semantic Web or Web 3.0. It provides meaning to imminent function, specifically to the process of content curation.

From whose who in the bitcoin space, to how they are related and who are they connected too.  From will increasing block size crush the nodes and centralize everything.  To how exactly lightning network works and is it actually viable.

I am still very early in my research and two things have popped out to me that leave a sour taste in my mouth about BTC though.  Blockstream has direct ties to world bankers, I am not sure how close they know them, I don't think its on a friendly call them up anytime situation.  They do meet with them though and discuss the future of bitcoin.

On top of that, I noticed in particular Theymos's response to what will happen if lightning network doesn't work out and his proposed solutions all lean towards centralizing the blockchain because it will be the best way to scale.  This has me somewhat worried as if they are starting to plant the seed as to get everyone prepared for it to fail but then automatically already conclude that the next best step in the network is to do what they have preseeded.

Anyway, not jumping to any conclusions yet and it is very clear nothing can stop BTC in the short term and it is also the only reliable trading pair.  If an exchange would come out with a BCH trading pairs into all alt coins I would be 100% BCH, but I can only trade vs BTC at the moment so I have no options as a trader.",1510831683.0,1,seemetouchme

EDIT: When I was a corehead, I heard (and believed) these kinds of arguments about BCH.  ""It's a scam coin.""  ""It's run by devious people who want to destroy Bitcoin.""  ""It's centralized.""  ""It's a pump and dump scam.""  And so on.

Since then, I've tried not to believe such claims without proof.  I've been watching Bitcoin Gold for a while and have seen essentially all of its security concerns apparently addressed in code before its launch, and aside from ideological differences (premine and such) the only thing I find it guilty of is a particularly rough start.

However, I don't hold any stake in BTG (unless holding [0.05 BTG](http://btgexp.com/address/GaVFSKpfh9hRqjFAU8T7ioit6jruQQDYdS) is considered a ""stake""), so I'd really like to know and see if there's actual evidence that Bitcoin Gold has replayed or has the ability to replay BTG transactions on the BTC (or any other) blockchain, because that would falsify its two-way replay protection claim and be a huge piece of evidence against it.

dpw089k,7d8pjq,"Yes [more info on this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d02ee/some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit/):

> I noticed a lot of people mentioning [Bilderberg's connection to AXA and BlockStream](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/47zfzt/blockstream_is_now_controlled_by_the_bilderberg/), recently with Jeff Berwick's two videos going viral as seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcyGg61PVGk) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQN8v-8RaN4).  It has been something I have been trying to warn people of for a while, and if you don't know what Bilderberg is you really need to [watch this excellent documentary about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/753ub7/the_axa_henri_de_castries_core_blockstream/).  The current chairman of the Bilderberg steering committee [Henri de Castries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_Castries) was also CEO of AXA until he announced retirement in 2016.  AXA is [one of the main funders of BlockStream and Bitcoin Core development](https://blockstream.com/2016/02/02/blockstream-new-investors-55-million-series-a.html). As one of the biggest insurance companies in the world AXA also benefits from the legacy too-big-to-fail bailout system, and Bitcoin is a threat to their way of life. AXA are also funding [technocratic totalitarian smart cities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKWuj1OlDPo), where they team up with governments for full control.  It is not surprising that they would want to get their fingers into Bitcoin.  

> Now lets dig a little deeper.  About 6 or 7 years ago, right before Satoshi disappeared, Gavin Andresen was invited to speak at the CIA.  He got an invitation directly from [In-Q-Tel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel) the CIA's venture capitalist funding arm. Gavin mentions how In-Q-Tel reached directly out to him [in this video @ 13sec mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yjrmIIpgo0&feature=youtu.be&t=13s) (I am not endorsing the rest of the content of this video).  In-Q-Tel basically helps fund and invest in companies that help equip the CIA with the latest information technology and capabilities.  You can look on [In-Q-Tel's website](https://www.iqt.org/) and see that they publicly invest in many innovative tech companies.  Some of these are public, there are no crypto companies listed, but they also at times make private investments as well.  Makes you wonder because they were interested enough to phone up Gavin Andresen personally and invite him for a speech, so in my opinion its highly likely they are investing somewhere in this space, and for what ends? We don't know.  We do know that certain companies have [captured the Core developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6tpyb9/patrick_byrne_ceo_of_overstock_has_lead_a/), and blocked common sense progress on Bitcoin, and that should be alarming.

> Further evidence that shows some type of coordination between these groups comes from Peter Thiel who has recently advocated [against Bitcoin as a cash system](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/78zhfx/bilderberger_peter_thiel_says_that_people_are/), and instead is pushing it [as a settlement system](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ari-paul-tuur-demeester-look-forward-to-up-to-1k-bitcoin-fees), the same narrative of BlockStream Core.  It may also be interesting to know that Peter Thiel has also attended Bilderberg regularly and [defends Bilderberg's secretive nature](https://www.rt.com/usa/346330-peter-thiel-bilderberg-libertarian-transparency/).  Thiel also is [partnering with In-Q-Tel and the CIA with his company Palantir](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4250750/Peter-Thiel-s-company-Palantir-built-CIA-funding.html#ixzz4wg9y00x0), which spies on everybody.  It is also interesting that at least one other VC funding firm Khosla Ventures [invested in BlockStream](https://blockstream.com/2016/02/02/blockstream-new-investors-55-million-series-a.html), and [also in the past has helped fund other companies that are working with In-Q-Tel](https://www.iqt.org/memsql-secures-investment-from-iqt-to-deliver-real-time-big-data-analytics/).  This was just from some quick research, only scratching the surface.

> I find these connections somewhat alarming, considering all of the community attacks I have seen going on.  Its possible that some groups are trying to strangle and control and co-opt Bitcoin.  It would make sense that they might try to force everyone off of the old model by jacking up fees, so users are herded onto something new in a 2nd layer solution that is more easily controlled. I believe segwit allows them to create an open door for trying to encourage Bitcoiners to move into their system, and the high fees is what they hope pushes users through that door. This is probably why we see so many attempts to move away from Satoshi's vision and the whitepaper.  Its why we see such a lack of common sense to simply raise the blocksize capacity.  Its why we see such draconian censorship, dirty tricks, lies, and diabolical political tactics.

dpvw3ia,7d8ngs,"Hello Bitcoin community,

Pictured is the very first physical bitcoin I ever produced. I made these coins as a homage to Satoshi Nakamoto and to help spread the word about Bitcoin and its ability to free us from the banks. I originally gave this coin to my grandfather, though it has come back into my possession since he has passed...

Bitcoin's genesis block contains this text published in The Times on January 3rd, 2009:

""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks""

Bitcoin was a response to corrupt banking institutions and a means to free us from their control.

People can choose to be their own bank with Bitcoin. At least they could, until ""Bitcoin Core"" eschewed the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and forced out Gavin Andresen, the man Satoshi himself trusted in carrying out this vision.

I remember in the early days one of the common arguments against bitcoin was that ""The powers that be"" would never allow it to usurp their control of our money. This turned out to be true. ""Bitcoin Core"" is now owned by the very institutions that bitcoin was built to overthrow.

Unfortunately for them, you cannot censor the the truth forever. Unfortunately for them, no corporation or entity controls what bitcoin is. We get to choose.

I say Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.

As such, I have completely divested from the legacy bitcoin chain. I have gone as far as moving the BTC off my grandfather's coin since Bitcoin Core makes a mockery of what it stands for.

Wiring takes a day max (can be same day if you do it by 1 PT) but also costs a flat $10 plus whatever your bank charges (probably $10-20). You'd have to deposit more than $750 to beat the 4% fee from debit/credit if you're paying $30 total to wire.

It’s interesting that his company is managing $5B yet is worth $22B. I know that’s how the basis of valuation of companies works, and crypto doesn’t follow his model. 
It does however fit CME’s models which they have been developing for over a year.

He states that it has never been tested. Many here would disagree, just what tests would be like to see?

I don’t see why he says you should put up 100% for buying a call. You either action it, or sell it or let it expire. Selling the contract on the other hand, yes, put up the margin. 

He states that there is no parallel in the”real” economy yet cites the silver run of 1980. One company had 1/3 of world supply. It was pumped on margin (looking at you tether) and heavy controls were brought in to remove it. 

This led to an inability on the holders to pay their margin calls a collapse in price and knock on failure of the agencies they owed.

His fear is that the clearing house will run out of money to balance positions in other markets. 

Surely that can be managed with required capital for margins and limits, as instituted by CME.

>It’s actually the opposite. Non-mining full nodes delay sending your transaction to the one node that really matters: a *mining* full node. Only mining full nodes have the ability to put your transaction in the blockchain, and you want to have that happen as soon as possible. To put it bluntly: “non-mining full nodes” are actually a sybil attack against mining full nodes. “Non-mining full nodes” make the network LESS efficient.

This is to verify your identity, and in the off chance the govt. needs this information for tax purposes, they know who to go after. But coinbase has fought against handing over these infos to the govt. CoinBase is also FDIC insured by the U.S. govt.

buy.bitcoin.com is probably the quickest way using a debit/credit card. Disclaimer that bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver, a once well looked-up on individual in the Bitcoin community, who's now pushing the agenda of owning Bitcoin cash. But it's a complete legit way of getting Bitcoin. The payments are processed by simplex, which processes credit/debit card payments for many other big exchanges like Bitstamp. The good thing about this one is that you'll 80% of the time, you'll not need an ID, but you will need an address. The bad is that you'll be paying a 7.5% fee compared to CoinBase's 5% fee, the exchange rate per bitcoin is also $100-$200 higher, making that you'll be paying about %1-2% more, basically expect to get a little more than 10% less Bitcoins. They justify these high fees with the fact that credit/debit card transactions can be charged back, but the same isn't true for Bitcoins. Also, if they think that anything fishy is going on with the information you give them (i.e. address), they'll send you an email asking for verification before they approve your transaction. You'll need to upload a picture of your Driver's License, ID etc... in that case.

Gemini is also good. They only accept wire-transfer from your linked bank. Basically once you create your account and you have everything verified, you'll be able to place Bitcoin orders immediately once you initiate a wire transfer.

- An Antminer s9 is best for directly mining bitcoin. If you can manage to buy from Bitmain's garbage site, it will cost you roughly $1400 USD in BCH, since that's all they take these days. Otherwise, you will have to buy them off ebay, and the going rate is at the very minimum $2500 each. Expect to pay $3000. 

- If you want to mine using [nicehash](https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator) using GPUs and having them pay you in bitcoin, you want to set up a [Rig that looks like this](https://blockoperations.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gpu_rig_zcash_x1200.png) - Basically, a bunch of GPUs, a processor, a mobo and risers all hooked up. This will run you $2000-$3000 depending on what kind of cards you get.

You cannot mine Bitcoin with GPUs. If you want to go the second route, [here is a good guide](http://www.coinminingrigs.com/how-to-build-a-6-gpu-mining-rig/).

If you want to get an s9 to mine, [here is a good setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PReyGNEKgAs).

https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty

This is the difficulty level. Put in current price, put in 14 TH/S. Subtract $100 a month for electricity.

Every month, you make approximately 8-10% less than this. Factor that into your cost. 

You can mine Bitcoin Cash at approximately the same value - It's using the same algorithm. 

You will reach ROI in roughly 6 months - After that is profit. By then your s9 will be fairly dated, likely a new machine will be out, it's nearing the end of its maximum production period.",1510792780.0,1,LargeSnorlax

One day we will live in a day and age where that is not the case, but right now we need to understand there will be an ongoing conversation about topics like this and no one can be offended by the other.  

New precedents are being made, and ultimately it relies on the specific ""terms and conditions"" of whatever retailer you choose to use.  Each retailer may have different takes on this and you need to make sure you are aware of the return policies of each retailer.  

As the bitcoin acceptance world becomes more ubiquitous, this can be leveraged and maybe you get the same bitcoin back even as it increased in price ""because other retailers are doing that"", but would you be willing to get your refund at a lesser bitcoin value? Assuming it goes *down* in price? I think not.

e.g. You have a legitimate return.  You paid 1 btc worth 1 bike at the time.  Now 20 days later, the price drops.  You get your 1 bitcoin back, but if you go out to spend it again, you can only buy 1/2 a bike due to the down turn.

Isn't it what's already happening on the other side where BCH is partly the result of a powerful miner who wanted to influence things to keep his patented mining 'exploit' in place, and pushing for bigger blocks to pave the way for more mining centralization in the future?

I am really seduced by the ideal of a decentralized system. But my knowledge of history and human nature tells me otherwise.
I do worry that all this is/could/will eventually boil down to 2 different factions each one fighting for leadership and accusing the other one to be the one ""centralizing"" while denying its own motives.

Try to research about bitcoin first to know what you are investing before you pour in your money.

This is a volatile market that would give you heartaches from time to time but investing long term would be worth it.

The people pushing the theory that Craig Wright is connected to Satoshi could not construct a logical argument even if their reputations depended on it, and they do. I do not believe that Dave Kleiman has anything to do with Satoshi, either. That 'evidence' is just as bad. There is a complete dearth of any evidence that is not EASILY faked (emails? come on.) that either of these two individuals is connected to Satoshi Nakamoto in any way.

I have yet to see a single article that contains rational believable arguments that *anybody* is Satoshi Nakamoto. They are all of a calibre that would not even pass muster in a first year college paper.

That some people have swallowed this kitchen-sink pile of crummy non-evidence is due to the fact that educational standards have clearly fallen and society is awash with people who have no clue whatsoever how to evaluate claims or how to tell whether something has been proven beyond doubt, and they are thus easily bamboozled by somebody who draws a lot of tenuous connections, posts easily editable 'proof', and engages in classic misdirection like claiming they are too autistic and anti-social to back up their extraordinary claims.",1510790934.0,7,technicoloursquirrel

In bitcoin, yes, if you have the keys, you're the owner.

""Lack"" meaning ""don't have"" or ""don't admit to""? If you ""don't have"" they keys, you're not the owner.  How can you prove I'm not Satoshi, by your rules, you can't prove I'm not, so maybe I am?

Hopefully the mailing address you put down on all those exchanges is correct because when they mail out a 1099 to you, they also mail one to the IRS.

70k is an insane prediction, however: I don't think the transaction speed of bitcoin is even allowing such a large spike right now. These investors will need to do a lot of business off-chain to keep the system fluid, because the blockchain itself is very sporadic with processing transactions, even with large fees. These traders are use to near-instant results, with brokers speeding up the process.

As I've been saying I have taken the biggest part of my pay ( 85 to 90% of it) in Bitcoin for over two years now.


 Im not an investor of any sorts I am just a person who works online and discovered Bitcoin because my employers offered to pay me a little bonus every week if I took my pay in Bitcoin rather than paypal, direct deposit, check, etc. I never used Bitcoin because of any other reason than it was a very efficient and effective way of collecting my pay. 


I have learned how to buy most everything I need with Bitcoin as well as how to convert it to cash if need be. This was fine and worked very well for me up until a few months ago. Once the price started raising really high something changed. I'm not sure if it was just increased traffic due to publicity or what but everyone knows how much different it has been using BTC the past few months than it was two years ago. 


All I'm trying to say is that personally I can't afford to use it like I did use it any longer. The cost of fees started adding up so much that I was noticably loosing money every week. Now it is much cheaper and faster for me to use any other available method to take my pay in. 


It bothers me when I hear folks preaching about how BTC is going to take over and replace Fiat and all that type of talk. You have to look at this from my point of view for one minute. I am not trying to run BTC down, I'm simply stating absolutely true experiences that I have encountered during the past few months.



 Something that I used as my bank, my wallet, and my debit card for over two years has changed so drastically that I can not afford to use it now. It is very aggravating for me that I had to go back to using direct deposit. But it is even more aggravating for me to come on some forums and see people that attack folks because they are listing very real problems with this currency. 




I mean look at how irate certain people get when the extremely high fees are mentioned. It is horrible imo that certain folks now act as if Bitcoin should only be used as an investment by the rich instead of a currency .we all know the fees are high but some folks can't even allow themselves to see that. 


Anyone who trys to claim they have not experienced these problems in the past couple months has not been actually using Bitcoin. There's just no way someone could have used BTC at the same frequency that I do (well I used to) can say they haven't either had to pay very high fees or else wait on stuck TXs more times than not over the past few months.



  I just found this sub Reddit tonight. I am very happy that I did because it seems like you folks see the same problems I see and are interested in fixing them.

Yep. That's the problem. If you need a few thousand dollars to run the only P2P part of the network for a node that generates you zero revenue then why would you use it? You want you'll out source those costs to someone else who is. But if a node can be run on $300 hardware (which is certainty can today and with larger blocks as well of a few MB) and do it on consumer broadband then then you (be it a hobbyist or a business) 

It's not just hardware too. It's internet bandwidth restrictions too and block propagation time across the network. 1 GB blocks would require gigabit internet.

Miners don't want 1 GB blocks either. Especially since many of them are in China where internet infrastructure is week. Big blocks increase orphan rate. Even if the hardware can handle it it's a matter of distributing that block across the entire network of nodes around the world, have each of them verify it in full, and then make sure that this all happens in the time span of 10 minutes, if it takes 11 minutes the system starts falling apart and it can't remain decentralized.

Ok now we increase to costs of running a node more. Now even the small business stop doing it because it's two expensive. So they out source it to the medium and large businesses.

Okay now we need more transaction capacity. Alright now it costs too much for the medium business. Why would they pay thousands of dollars when  the large business will let them use their nodes?

Oh now there's only a handful of large businesses running nodes, enforcing the ruleset, propagating transactions, validating blocks. Well then it's suddenly centralized. That also means it's easy to censor transactions for them. It's easy for them to know who's sending what too. 

Decentralization is dependant on having many small little participants in the network. The more little participants having a tiny role the more decentralized. The less participants the more centralized.

The bigger the blocks the more centralized the smaller them more decentralized. That's a fact. Every time we increase block size that much he acknowledged.

Maybe it's just me being argumentative, but I easily have a problem with the first thing you say, just like OP.  People have this idea that what some nitwit is saying in some reddit sub, is what someone else believes.  I don't agree with that.

I do not believe that the core developers believe BTC should not be currency.  I simply do not.

  As you mentioned BTC has ""has been used as currency for years up until the 1 MB blocks started getting full"".  So it seems they hit a scaling issue.  I'm guessing they are working on it.

The way this sub talks BCH has fixed everything and is here to save the world.  To me it sounds like they've watched one to many Roger Ver videos.

Anyways, good luck to BCH, but I have very little interest in it.  (Well why are you in a bitcoin cash sub? lol don't get me started on that either)

dpvsddf,7d806m,">Dear Chairman Giancarlo:
I am the Chairman and founder of Interactive Brokers LLC, a futures commission merchant and
broker-dealer with over $ 3.8 billion in regulatory net capital and over $1.2 billion in client margin
funds (Interactive Brokers Group is publicly traded on Nasdaq with a market cap of over $22 billion).
As a CME clearing member, we are deeply concerned with proposals that would allow Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrency derivatives to be cleared in the same clearing organization as other products.

>This letter is to request that the Commission require that any clearing organization that wishes to clear
any cryptocurrency or derivative of a cryptocurrency do so in a separate clearing system isolated from
other products.

>There is no fundamental basis for valuation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and they may
assume any price from one day to the next. This has been illustrated quite clearly in 2017 as the price
of Bitcoin has increased by nearly 1000%.

>Cryptocurrencies do not have a mature, regulated and tested underlying market. The products and
their markets have existed for fewer than 10 years and bear little if any relationship to any economic
circumstance or reality in the real world.

>Margining such a product in a reasonable manner is impossible. While the buyer (the long side) of a
cryptocurrency futures contract or call option could be required to put up 100% of the value to ensure
safety, determining the margin requirement for the seller (the short side) is impossible.

>Instituting daily price move limits on cryptocurrency derivatives does not solve the problem. In a
runaway upward market for example (like the silver market in the 1980’s caused by the Hunt brothers),
the futures price gets locked limit-up day after day with little or no trading and the short sellers are
unable to cover, leading them (and potentially their clearing firms) to ruin.

>If the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or any other clearing organization clears a cryptocurrency
together with other products, then a large cryptocurrency price move that destabilizes members that
clear cryptocurrencies will destabilize the clearing organization itself and its ability to satisfy its
fundamental obligation to pay the winners and collect from the losers on the other products in the
same clearing pool.

>Accordingly, even clearing members who do not wish to clear cryptocurrencies because they judge the
risk to be too great cannot isolate themselves and their customers from a potentially catastrophic loss
from cryptocurrency risk at the clearing organization.

>Thus, it is no answer for the proponents of clearing these products to suggest that objecting clearing
members can simply charge very large margins or not offer cryptocurrencies at all. In a central
clearing organization, all members are at risk for the activities of any member (and of the clearing
organization itself).

>Unless the risk of clearing cryptocurrency is isolated and segregated from other products, a catastrophe
in the cryptocurrency market that destabilizes a clearing organization will destabilize the real economy,
as critical equity index and commodity markets cleared in the same clearing organization become
infected.

>The only way to protect clearing organizations and their members (and the financial system as a
whole) from the unique risks inherent in clearing cryptocurrencies is to require that they be cleared in a
separate clearing system, isolated from other products.

>We would be happy to discuss this with you or to provide any further information at your convenience.

There is a problem though, if that is true, then core can just do a block size hard fork at any time. Then, they'll have the chain with the same technical merit as BCH, but with ~6x market cap and massive adoption compared to BCH. If block size really is the way forward, then BCH could be made irrelevant instantly.

I agree BTC is expensive and the mempool is shocking. However, crypto is still non-mainstream. I think in a couple of years adoption will rise and new solutions will be available. The market is putting their chips on BTC, and I see most innovation there too, even if it's slow as molasses.

If you read tech news and watch youtube vids on stuff people are doing with BTC it looks exciting and innovative (but again, slow as molasses). Whereas BCH news seems to be all anti-core, negative, with nothing genuinely exciting from an innovation perspective.

dpvt5k9,7d7yqu,">Expensive molasses won't cut it for any adopter.

It does for investors who see it as insurance against inflation and economic uncertainty. In fact the fees and maintenance are actually quite good compared to current alternatives. I know people don't want to hear that, but it's the current situation. People will say ""it's meant to be cash"", well, sometimes things are used for different purposes than the creator intended, look at [Zyklon B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zyklon_B), a bit extreme, but you get the idea. It doesn't have to be this way forever though, new ideas will be constantly tested and improved upon.

However, I personally have doubts that a deflationary asset will ever be used as more than a store of value when inflationary currencies (fiat) exist, but that's a whole other topic.

>Core has proven their inability or unwillingness to scale over a period of YEARS. I don't see evidence of anything beyond that

BTC has a market cap of $121bn, if that is genuinely at risk, I'm sure core will do a PoW or block size change, or someone will force them to. There's no way that much money will disappear without someone doing an emergency change. Will it work?

dpvtgd8,7d7yqu,"Hmm. So, in sum, you don't think Bitcoin has any economic potential to be a peer to peer electronic cash system at all?

Sure that's your prerogative, but I believe differently. I happen to think that there are legs to it, and that BCH maintains those qualities.

dpvt5ok,7d7yqu,"**Zyklon B**

Zyklon B (US:  ( listen); German: [tsykloːn ˈbeː] ( listen); translated Cyclone B) was the trade name of a cyanide-based pesticide invented in Germany in the early 1920s. It consisted of hydrogen cyanide (prussic acid), as well as a cautionary eye irritant and one of several adsorbents such as diatomaceous earth. The product is infamous for its use by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust to murder approximately one million people in gas chambers installed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and other extermination camps.

Hydrogen cyanide, a poisonous gas that interferes with cellular respiration, was first used as a pesticide in California in the 1880s.

dpvtzxw,7d7yqu,"> So, in sum, you don't think Bitcoin has any economic potential to be a peer to peer electronic cash system at all.

Not quite, I just think it needs to be expanded upon to achieve that. In the same way that the Internet in the 90's could not be expected to do what the Internet of today does, so too must crypto tech be iterated upon to achieve its potential.

I don't think endless block size increases are the way to get there. If you really are a dev, then I know you probably constantly think about new ways to achieve a goal that uses less resources, cuts the fat, or uses a clever efficiency to get more performance. I think this is how crypto will move forward, and I see that happening with BTC (even if it is slow), but not really with BCH.

Even if bitcoin becomes more of a value store (due to being deflationary), being able to move it around in fractions of a penny rapidly is still *very* valuable, and I hope that goal is achieved.

On a more fundamental level, I think *any* asset that is deflationary will tend to be hoarded, as long as an inflationary alternative exists (government mandated fiat), this is the basis of [Gresham's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law). Maybe there will be inflationary cryptos that could have atomic swaps between bitcoin? I don't know.",1510791076.0,2,jealous_monk_licker
dpvu02o,7d7yqu,"**Gresham's law**

In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that ""bad money drives out good"". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.

The law was named in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors.

There are not that many conditions that need to be met to make the flippining start and even fewwer to add to the situation that may make it breach the point of no return.  

Very simply the EDA is an evolution in survival that gives bitcoin cash a huge advantage.  Bitcoin segwit doesn't have this defense and is very very vulnerable to loosing miners.  

Something as simple as a price pump in Bitcoin cash,  or a sell off in the segwit coin for any reason could start the ball rolling. 

Second the miners see the profitability shift and move chains.  

Third the movement of miners increases the value of the coin they move to, and hence feed back profit loop starts on bitcoin cash.  

The difficulty of the bitcoin chain doesn't adjust fast enough and blocks get longer and longer.

dpvqum1,7d7vhw,I’m confused. What’s that all about?,1510787475.0,1,cdooer
dpvrg9i,7d7vhw,"Ok I’ll explain.  So Bitcoin Cash just had a hard fork of their own in an effort to fix the huge difficulty and hashpower swings that come with the EDA.  I haven’t found solid details about the new DAA they use but it sounds like the difficulty adjust every block. 

Well the hard fork went through, and they didn’t implement replay protection because obviously “it’s unnecessary, and we don’t want to force everyone to upgrade.”  

Here’s the problem.  Someone has continued to hash the EDA chain that got forked and is calling it Bitcoin Clashic.  I think they have 2 or 3 blocks last I checked.  It appears to be an entirely troll coin, but represents a *serious vulnerability* in the Bcash fork.  For all compatible clients, they will follow the *longest valid chain.* Meaning if the Bitcoin Clashic chain takes over the number of blocks, *the entire fork will be orphaned.*

So my first thought is, “but no one will mine it so that’s not a big deal”.  Except the EDA makes that completely irrelevant.  They don’t need a ton of hash power, they just need enough to make it to the first difficulty adjustment.  Then when the EDA kicks in, if any significant mining power jumps on the Bitcoin Clashic chain they will start mining blocks by the second.  If that continues and they make it far enough to start catching up, the entire Bcash V2 (whatever it’s called) will get dumped and *even worse,* because there is no replay protection, anyone who made transaction since the fork might see their BCH vanish into inaccessible addresses that they can no longer unlock.  

I couldn’t stop laughing while reading their page because it’s hilarious.  But it’s also super scary and not a trivial problem.  This could potentially obliterate BCH reputation causing a death spiral.  And because they insist on using the same hash algorithm, BCH could actually die. 

Maybe nothing will come of it, but I would be super worried if I was holding BCH right now.",1510788153.0,13,Cryptoconomy

The Clashic chain difficulty must be really high currently though, right? I mean, this fork was right at the time of The Great BitCHcoin War. So how long are we looking at for the adjustment?

BCH is one aspect of the lancing of the BTC bubble. But what about when people begin to rally around non general purpose coins simply because of some product or service?

For example : Amazon decides to just say, fuck the current market, and they just make their own crypto currency and the also make a special Amazon exchange that uses the Amazon coins as the base currency. So now Amazon is soaking up other coins on the market without having to spend a dime. Amazon can also be holding on to a few billion of these coins right out of the gate. Suddenly you need to buy Amazon coins to use a bunch of their services. Every big corporation has the ability to do this right now, even the ones who are already monopolistic. Actually, especially monopolistic corporations.

Each of these big companies can make billions out of almost thin air by making a coin that is centered around a good or service. And people would view the coins as an investment with innate value. Then, they can simply manipulate the market to make the value of the coins go up for trillions of dollars in profits. Normies would be using, investing and owning these coins with adoption rates that pale the numbers we see now.

Suddenly Walmart begins paying its employees in Walmart coins... The cycle this goes down would be fucking insane.

We rely on our bank to protect our personal accounts against these inevitable attacks. This is expensive and unsettling for everyone involved. Somehow we collectively came to terms that our personal information is insecure and we ought to deal with it.

Then came crypto. We have the ability to transact in both a public and secure way. Your private information stays private, and the decentralized system ensures a much higher level of security than the previous way.

It's not user friendly right now. Grandma can't easily transact with crypto to buy lawn furniture. But imagine a company like request network or whoever does it first, the decentralized PayPal. Easy to use, secured on the blockchain. Now you have an unstoppable wave- once usability is perfected, there must be a flood to do business in crypto. It is simply the better way to do business.

dpvv4pp,7d7mwa,copy. and when I just send USD to the exchange? sounds like if everyone wanted to withdraw coin at once they'd face the same problems a bank might. ,1510792424.0,1,usingtoregister
dpvvgmv,7d7mwa,"That is why most people say don't keep your bitcoin/money on an exchange. It's hard if you are active trading, but if you are a holder its a good idea to get it off. You have to trust an exchange, so people only use exchanges in their own country to withdraw USD (for instance) so they have somewhat a safer experience. 

Bitfinex is an example of an exchange that used to allow USD but no longer does. You can transact on the exchange, but must withdraw in crypto if you are in the US.

When you send to the exchange, they hold the private keys and choose what access to give you in the future.

Atomic swaps may hold the future to this problem, no exchange needed.

The segwit block, therefore, which is near the practical limit of bitcoin’s current blocksize rules, was able to handle only 500 more inputs and outputs out of some 11,000. Making it an increase of just 5%, instead of 50% as would be the case for a non-segwit 1.6MB block.

So if you want to check, you can check each and every signature. And if you are in a trust-less environment, you should check each and every signature as a consensus rule.

That ""aggregated signature"" you mentioned is called a Merkle root. The fact remains that Segwit transactions are NOT part of the Merkle Tree whose root is in the block header, they are in separate Merkle Tree with a whose root in the Coinbase transaction, then that tx is subsequently hashed into the Merkle Tree the root of which is in the actual block header.

Okay, but the concepts lined out in the white paper are nearly bullet-proof.

Okay, so what part of the white paper do you specifically have an issue with? I ask because a lot of what Bitcoin Core does is not in there. What part do you specifically think is ""outdated"" or not applicable? (besides the node/miner generalization which was clarified later on.)

There is no ""standard transduction"", there are valid transactions and invalid transactions. There may be transactions that are done far more often than other transactions, but bitcoin is censorship resistant and any transaction that fits the consensus rules is considered a valid transaction, and if a miner includes it in the block, it is a completed tx.

Thank you, I'm aware. I simplified some things as well. 

> As you said yourself, a transaction doesn't even need to be valid to be included in the block, this also applies to a Coinbase transaction.

I don't believe I specified anything of the sort, because that's an absurd statement. All transactions. Need to be valid. And if you run through the Segwit transactions and find one that isn't valid, you should reject the block. The Coinbase is a valid tx as well because being designated at tx index 0 it has other rules that apply to it, but it must also conform to those rules as well. I can't just make a Coinbase that pays me 1000 BTC.

I'm confused by this statement? Are you still hung up on there being invalid txs in the MR? Because that's simply false. Sure it's possible, but it's possible to put invalid txs in the main block as well. That doesn't make the block any more valid because it is in the separate block. If you aren't checking each and every tx, shame on you. Just because he second block is optional doesn't mean rules don't apply to it the same it just means you are trusting someone else to validate them. I don't see how this is any different than an SPV node which only looks at your relevant information. 

> That would be a [green paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_paper) not a [white paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper)

Sorry, white papers change all the time as well, in fact, where I work I've written 3 this last week, and 2 of them are on Rev 6 going back from the 80s. 

> See?

See what? No where does it state the document is a steadfast roadmap that shouldn't be changed when better ideas come along. I think quadratic scaling for a quadratic problem is a far better idea than linear scaling for a linear problem. 

> Okay, but the concepts lined out in the white paper are nearly bullet-proof.

Sorry, that's too cultish for me. He was a man not a god. No one is infallible. Let's find rev 0 of the lunar lander, build it, and send you up in it. Have fun. 


> Okay, so what part of the white paper do you specifically have an issue with? I ask because a lot of what Bitcoin Core does is not in there. What part do you specifically think is ""outdated"" or not applicable? (besides the node/miner generalization which was clarified later on.)

I personally don't necessarily have an issue with miner centralization and think it is temporary in the long term. I don't believe any proposed idea in the white paper should be considered set in stone however. Let's pretend it calls out standard vs. non standard transactions and classifies them, I don't think limiting bitcoin to just what one man thought was standard 8 years ago should limit all future creative ability. Your entire argument rides on the fact that Segwit doesn't look ""normal"" with respect to history of the protocol or the white paper but normal is entirely subjective. I would say including many transactions into the same block accounting by segregating the signatures is a very clever idea and is far superior to the original ""standard"" txs, but I also don't limit your ability to do so.

dpwicel,7d7k6e,"**Green paper**

In the European Union, Commonwealth countries, Hong Kong and the United States, a green paper is a tentative government report and consultation document of policy proposals for debate and discussion. A green paper represents the best that the government can propose on the given issue, but, remaining uncommitted, it is able without loss of face to leave its final decision open until it has been able to consider the public reaction to it. Green papers may result in the production of a white paper. They may be considered as grey literature.

***

**White paper**

A white paper is an authoritative report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body's philosophy on the matter. It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision.

The initial British term concerning a type of government-issued document has proliferated, taking a somewhat new meaning in business. In business, a white paper is closer to a form of marketing presentation, a tool meant to persuade customers and partners and promote a product or viewpoint.

These things break even in under than 6 months and currently output around 0.9 btc in one year (less as the difficulty increases). A nice trickle of bitcoins beats having a set amount, just like the beauty of passive income. 10k today would get you less than 1.4 btc. 2 antminer S9's will get you 1.8 btc in just over a year. Plus once they become unprofitable (not for a while) you can sell them on ebay for no loss as they would have already paid for themselves in bitcoin. This is just what I would do with $10k right now.",1510789875.0,1,-NeverSoft

dpvo2gh,7d7gzp,"I think a more interesting lesson has to do with Luther and Zwingli. I think this BCH / BTC split is like the first reformation split. Luther and Zwingli agreed on 14 of 15 major points, but could not come to terms on the final one. 

""Luther and Zwingli, born within seven weeks of one another, were co-originators of the Protestant Reformation. Though neither one intended it from the beginning, the reforming movements which they started would lead inexorably to a division in Western Christendom. In addition, though neither one desired it, their differences on the Eucharist would tragically lead to the first major split in Reformation Protestantism between the Lutherans and the Reformed. Though they had much in common—and more often the differences are emphasized rather than the similarities—they were indeed adversaries.""",1510784437.0,1,Jamis1979
dpvohnn,7d7gzp,"I found it slightly difficult to follow given the language he uses is above mine but the context I grasped from this read was as advice to those who reside under the Catholic denomination. 

MLK seems to encourage true repentance from within which bears fruit externally and to draw away from the papal cannons which don't necessarily reflect the written word of God. So you are right when you say money can't pay for atonement of sins. 

What I don't understand is the relevance of this in r/btc but still an enjoyable and uplifting read to reflect on in a time where work and chasing that money seems to consume most of daily life, so thanks for that OP. 

My heart is heavy after being reminded of the loss of such a bright light within a darkening world. I hope his character continues to impart on our global society and embolden the light found within each of us. ",1510784885.0,2,gallophilips
